Scope note:
This property associates an instance of F1 Work with an instance of E28 Conceptual Object that represents a generalization of the work. The property can be used to group variant, alternative or related works that are considered to share a common concept.
Whereas instances of F1 Work are always realised in instances of F2 Expression, there is no particular expression that fully conveys the instance of Conceptual Object that a work may be a member of.
Intended usage of the property includes what is discussed as “superwork” in the library community. Typical examples are novels that can be grouped by fictional universes or common characters, paintings or graphical works that exist as a family of alternatives, musical compositions that are referred to as the same although they exist as particular versions that are each identified as an individual work. The instance of E28 Conceptual Object that has works as members will often be constructed for a specific purpose, such as bibliographic organization or retrieval.

Examples:
- Auguste Rodin’s ‘Le penseur’ (E28) has member Auguste Rodin’s ‘Le penseur’ in monumental size (F1). [In original size this sculpture forms part of (R67i) Rodin’s ‘La Porte de l’Enfer’ (F1); in monumental size it is an autonomous work. All scale variants are members of (R10) the superwork ‘Le penseur’(E28).]
- Edward Munch’s ‘Madonna’ (E28) has member Edward Munch’s black and white graphical work ‘Madonna’ (F1).
- Edward Munch’s ‘Madonna’ (E28) has member Edward Munch’s painting ‘Madonna’ (F1).
- Ludwig van Beethoven’s opera Op. 72 ‘Fidelio’ (E28) has member Ludwig van Beethoven’s opera ‘Leonore, oder Der Triumph der ehelichen Liebe’ (the initial version that was performed in 1805) (F1).
- Ludwig van Beethoven’s opera Op. 72 ‘Fidelio’ (E28) has member Ludwig van Beethoven’s opera ‘Fidelio’ (the final version that was first performed in 1814) (F1).
- The fictional universe created by Terry Pratchett referred to as ‘Discworld’ (E28) has member Terry Pratchett’s novel ‘The Light Fantastic’ (F1).
- The fictional universe created by Terry Pratchett referred to as ‘Discworld’ (E28) has member ‘Where’s my Cow’, a picture book by Terry Pratchett and Melvyn Grant (F1).

This property associates an instance of E90 Symbolic Object with an instance of F2 Expression of which it is a fragment. The fragment is not itself an instance of F2 Expression as it does not express any instance of F1 Work. When the fragment consists of intelligible words it is an instance of E33 Linguistic Object.
An instance of E90 Symbolic Object is only considered a fragment of an instance of F2 Expression when related to its occurrence in a known or assumed whole by the R15 has fragment (is fragment of) property. The size of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object ranges from more than 99% of an instance of F2 Expression to tiny bits (a few words from a text, one bar from a musical composition, one detail from a still image, a two-second clip from a video, etc.).
An instance of E90 Symbolic Object can become a fragment of an instance of F2 Expression through the deterioration over time of a carrier of the expression, such as when only fragments of a manuscript of an ancient text survive. Typically instances of E90 Symbolic Object that are of interest as fragments of expressions are formed deliberately, such as when excerpts are taken from a text by the compiler of a collection of excerpts, or citations from one expression are used in another text.

Examples:
- The ancient Greek text of the four stanzas from an ode by Sappho (E33) that were quoted by Pseudo-Longinus in his textual work entitled ‘On the sublime’ is fragment of the complete ancient Greek text, now irremediably lost, of Sappho’s ode currently identified as Sappho’s poem #2 (F2).
- The phrase ‘Beati pauperes spiritu’ (E33) is fragment of the Latin text of the Gospel according to St. Matthew (F2). [excerpt from Matthew 5,3]
- The stanza ‘Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita / mi ritrovai per una selva oscura / ché la diritta via era smarrita’ (E33) is fragment of the Italian text of Dante Alighieri’s ‘Inferno’ from the ‘Divina Commedia’ (F2).
- The widely recognized ominous four-note opening motif (E73) is fragment of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony (F2).
- The melting clock (E36) is fragment of the painting ‘Persistence of Memory’ by Salvador Dali, 1931 (F2).

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property associates an instance of F2 Expression that was externalised during a particular instance of F28 Expression Creation event with that particular creation event. An instance of expression creation creates an instance of expression and also creates any expressions that are parts of that expression.

Examples of the inverse property:
- Agatha Christie creating the text for her novel ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ (F28) created the original English text of Agatha Christie’s ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ (F2).
- Elisabeth van Bebber creating the text of her translation of Agatha Christie’s ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ (F28) created the German text of Agatha Christie’s ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ (F2).
- Ludwig van Beethoven composing his ‘Symphony No. 9’ (F28) created the original score for the 9th Symphony (F2).
- The making of the censored version of Hitchcock’s movie ‘Psycho’ (F28) created the original version (cut) of the movie that was released in Britain (F2).
- The making of the first plaster version of ‘The Thinker’ sculpture by Auguste Rodin (F28) created the plaster version of ‘The Thinker’ (F2).
- The making of the large-scale version of ‘The Thinker’ by the Fonderie Alexis Rudier in 1904 (F28) created the large-scale version of ‘The Thinker’ (F2).

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of an F2 Expression X with a structural component Y that conveys a part of the overall work realized by X, such as volumes, chapters, or sections. This property is transitive, asymmetric and irreflexive.
Any part of an expression that conveys complete propositions, such as a single phrase, can be documented using the more general property P148 has component (is component of).
Any part of an expression that does not completely follow meaningful boundaries, such as lines or pages of text or portions visible on images, can be documented using the property P106 is composed of (forms part of), and not with R5 has component (is component of). Fragments, in particular, can be documented with the more specific property R15 has fragment (is fragment of).
This property does not cover the relationship that exists between expressions that are realisations of different works, where one is re-used in a new, larger expression. Such a relationship is modelled by R75 incorporates (is incorporated in).

Examples:
- The musical notation for Bach’s ‘Goldberg Variations’ (F2) has component the musical notation for ‘Variatio 1. a 1 Clav’ (F2).
- The Italian text of Dante’s textual work entitled ‘Divina Commedia’ (F2) has component the Italian text of Dante’s textual work entitled ‘Inferno’ (F2).
- The musical notation of Mozart’s Singspiel entitled ‘Die Zauberflöte’ (F2) has component the musical notation of Mozart’s aria entitled ‘Der Hölle Rache’, also known as ‘The Queen of the Night’s Aria’ (F2).
- The visual content of the map entitled ‘Wales – The Midlands – South West England’, scale 1:400,000, issued by Michelin in 2005 (F2) has component the visual content of the inset entitled ‘Liverpool’, scale 1:200,000, set within the compass of the map titled ‘Wales – The Midlands – South West England’, scale 1:400,000, issued by Michelin in 2005 (F2).

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of F3 Manifestation with an instance of E54 Dimension that describes aspects of its symbolic content, such as word counts, or describes the kind of physical form that characterizes instances of F5 Item carrying this F3 Manifestation, such as number of pages.
This inference is an induction along the path that can be modelled as: F3 Manifestation. R7i is exemplified by: F5 Item. P43 has dimension (is dimension of): E54 Dimension.
It can happen that a given item, or subset of items, originally produced, or intended to be produced, with a certain value for a particular kind of dimension, has a different value for this kind of dimension by accident. This fact should be recorded as a property of F5 Item, and not of F3 Manifestation.

Examples:
- The publication (printed book) entitled ‘Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records: final report’, published by K. G. Saur in 1998, identified by ISBN ‘3-598-11382-X’ (F3) has dimension height (E54) [which has value (P90) 24 (E60) and has unit (P91) cm (E58)].
- The publication (printed book) entitled ‘A clockwork orange’ by Anthony Burgess, published by Penguin Books Ltd in 2008, identified by ISBN ‘0141037229’ (F3) has dimension number of pages (E54) [which has value (P90) 176 (E60)].

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property associates an instance of F3 Manifestation with an instance of E54 Dimension that describes aspects of its symbolic content, such as word counts, or describes the kind of physical form that characterizes instances of F5 Item carrying this F3 Manifestation, such as number of pages.
This inference is an induction along the path that can be modelled as: F3 Manifestation. R7i is exemplified by: F5 Item. P43 has dimension (is dimension of): E54 Dimension.
It can happen that a given item, or subset of items, originally produced, or intended to be produced, with a certain value for a particular kind of dimension, has a different value for this kind of dimension by accident. This fact should be recorded as a property of F5 Item, and not of F3 Manifestation.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The publication (printed book) entitled ‘Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records: final report’, published by K. G. Saur in 1998, identified by ISBN ‘3-598-11382-X’ (F3) has dimension height (E54) [which has value (P90) 24 (E60) and has unit (P91) cm (E58)].
- The publication (printed book) entitled ‘A clockwork orange’ by Anthony Burgess, published by Penguin Books Ltd in 2008, identified by ISBN ‘0141037229’ (F3) has dimension number of pages (E54) [which has value (P90) 176 (E60)].

Shortcut Of: F1 Work. P140i was attributed by: E13 Attribute Assignment. P16 uses specific object: F2 Expression

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of F1 Work with instances of F2 Expression that bear attributes which are used to characterize the work. The instance of F2 Expression in question must be one that realizes that instance of F1 Work. An instance of F2 Expression may or may not serve as source of representative expression attributes for its associated instance of F1 Work. If it does, it may provide one attribute or many. Only one or more than one of the instances of F2 Expression associated with an instance of F1 Work may provide attributes that characterize that instance of F1 Work. The representative expression attributes can all come from the same expression or from more than one expressions.

Examples:
- The work ‘Reading for life, a first book for adults and their tutors’ by Virginia French Allen (F1) takes representative attribute from the expression first published in 1987 by Spring Institute for International Studies with ISBN ‘094072300X’ (F2). [One attribute is the value for intended audience, which is adult literacy learners in the English language, another attribute is the language English.]
- The expression of the work ‘Piglet has a bath’ by A. A. Milne, with illustrations by Ernest H. Shepard, realised in the edition published on sealed plastic pages by Dutton Children’s Books in 1998 with ISBN ‘0525460926’ (F2) bears representative attribute for the work ‘Piglet has a bath’ by A. A. Milne (F1). [One attribute is the language English; another is the value for intended audience, which is children.]
- The work ‘Fugue in G Minor, BWV 1000’ by Johann Sebastian Bach (F1) takes representative attribute from the original expression (F2) (as composed around 1723). [The attribute is lute as the mode of performance; it is now mostly performed on the guitar.]

Shortcut Of of the inverse property: F1 Work. P140i was attributed by: E13 Attribute Assignment. P16 uses specific object: F2 Expression

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property associates an instance of F1 Work with instances of F2 Expression that bear attributes which are used to characterize the work. The instance of F2 Expression in question must be one that realizes that instance of F1 Work. An instance of F2 Expression may or may not serve as source of representative expression attributes for its associated instance of F1 Work. If it does, it may provide one attribute or many. Only one or more than one of the instances of F2 Expression associated with an instance of F1 Work may provide attributes that characterize that instance of F1 Work. The representative expression attributes can all come from the same expression or from more than one expressions.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The work ‘Reading for life, a first book for adults and their tutors’ by Virginia French Allen (F1) takes representative attribute from the expression first published in 1987 by Spring Institute for International Studies with ISBN ‘094072300X’ (F2). [One attribute is the value for intended audience, which is adult literacy learners in the English language, another attribute is the language English.]
- The expression of the work ‘Piglet has a bath’ by A. A. Milne, with illustrations by Ernest H. Shepard, realised in the edition published on sealed plastic pages by Dutton Children’s Books in 1998 with ISBN ‘0525460926’ (F2) bears representative attribute for the work ‘Piglet has a bath’ by A. A. Milne (F1). [One attribute is the language English; another is the value for intended audience, which is children.]
- The work ‘Fugue in G Minor, BWV 1000’ by Johann Sebastian Bach (F1) takes representative attribute from the original expression (F2) (as composed around 1723). [The attribute is lute as the mode of performance; it is now mostly performed on the guitar.]

Inverse Shortcut Of: F3 Manifestation. R4 embodies: F2 Expression. R4i is embodied by: F3 Manifestation

Scope note:
This property associates one instance of F3 Manifestation with another instance of F3 Manifestation that exemplifies the same instance of F2 Expression, when the two instances of F3 Manifestation can be used as alternatives for each other in particular use cases. This property is transitive and symmetric. It is irreflexive.
The alternative manifestations may be in the same physical form, for example, simultaneous publications in different markets. More frequently, the alternative relationship is established when the alternative manifestations are in different physical forms, designed to enable use of the same content with different playback equipment (such as a DVD and Blu-ray disc version of the same videorecording).

Examples:
- Agatha Christie’s ‘The Sittaford Mystery’ published in 1931 in the UK by William Collins & Sons (F3) has alternate the simultaneous US edition published as ‘The Murder at Hazelmoor’ by Dodd, Mead & Co. (F3).
- The LP release of the punk rock band the Soviettes’ album titled ‘LP III’ (F3) has alternate the CD release of the punk rock band the Soviettes’ album titled ‘LP III’ (F3).

This property associates an instance of F1 Work with an instance of E55 Type that describes a category of attribute that is considered essential in characterizing instances of F1 Work. The types of interest will vary depending on the kind of work.
The value of the attribute is considered representative of the instance of F1 Work.

Examples:

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E35 Title that has been applied to an instance of E71 Human-Made Thing. 
The P102.1 has type property of the P102 has title (is title of) property enables the relationship between the title and the thing to be further clarified, for example, if the title was a given title, a supplied title etc.
It allows any human-made material or immaterial thing to be given a title. It is possible to imagine a title being created without a specific object in mind.

Examples:

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property associates an instance of E35 Title that has been applied to an instance of E71 Human-Made Thing. 
The P102.1 has type property of the P102 has title (is title of) property enables the relationship between the title and the thing to be further clarified, for example, if the title was a given title, a supplied title etc.
It allows any human-made material or immaterial thing to be given a title. It is possible to imagine a title being created without a specific object in mind.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The first book of the Old Testament (E33) has title “Genesis” (E35) has type translated title (E55) (E55). (Brueggemann, 1982)
- Monet’s painting from 1868-1869 held by Musée d’Orsay, Paris, under inventory number RF 1984 164 (E22) has title “La Pie” (E35) has type creator’s title (E55). (Musée d’Orsay, 2020)

Scope note:
This property links an instance of E71 Human-Made Thing to an instance of E55 Type of usage or audience. It creates a relation between specific human-made things, both physical and immaterial, to E55 Types. This property can be used to specify intended methods and techniques of use or to characterise the intended audience by indicating a type of personal characteristic that everyone falling into the target audience has. 
Note: A link between specific human-made things and a specific use activity should be expressed using P19 was intended use of (was made for).

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property links an instance of E71 Human-Made Thing to an instance of E55 Type of usage or audience. It creates a relation between specific human-made things, both physical and immaterial, to E55 Types. This property can be used to specify intended methods and techniques of use or to characterise the intended audience by indicating a type of personal characteristic that everyone falling into the target audience has. 
Note: A link between specific human-made things and a specific use activity should be expressed using P19 was intended use of (was made for).

Examples of the inverse property:
- This plate (E22) was intended for being destroyed at wedding reception (E55). (fictitious)
- “Reading for life, a first book for adults and their tutors” (E28) was intended for adult literacy learners in the English language (E55). (Allen, 1987)
- “Piglet has a bath” (E28), published on sealed plastic pages, was intended for young children having a bath (E55). (Milne & Shepard, 1998)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P103(x,y) ⇒ E71(x)
- P103(x,y) ⇒ E55(y)

Examples:
- The Beatles back catalogue (E73) right held by Michael Jackson (E21). (Raga, 2016)

In First Order Logic:
- P105(x,y) ⇒ E72(x)
- P105(x,y) ⇒ E39(y)
- P105(x,y) ⇐ (∃z) [E30(z) ˄ P104(x,z) ˄ P75i(z,y)]

This property associates an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume with another instance of E92 Spacetime Volume that falls within the latter. In other words, all points in the former are also points in the latter.
This property is transitive and reflexive.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The Great Plague (E4) falls within The Gothic period (E4). (Porter, 2009)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P10(x,y) ⇒ E92(x)
- P10(x,y) ⇒ E92(y)
- P10(x,y) ⇒ P132(x,y)
- P10(x,y) ∧ P10(y,z)] ⇒ P10(x,z)
- P10(x,x)

Scope note:
This property describes the active or passive participation of instances of E39 Actors in an instance of E5 Event. 
It documents known events in which an instance of E39 Actor has participated during the course of that actor’s life or history. The instances of E53 Place and E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide constraints about the presence of the related instances of E39 Actor in the past. Collective actors, i.e. instances of E74 Group, may physically participate in events via their representing instances of E21 Persons only. The participation of multiple actors in an event is most likely an indication of their acquaintance and interaction.
The property implies that the actor was involved in the event but does not imply any causal relationship. For instance, someone having been portrayed can be said to have participated in the creation of the portrait.

Examples:
- Napoleon (E21) participated in The Battle of Waterloo (E7). (Dawson, 2018)
- Maria (E21) participated in Photographing of Maria (E7). (fictitious)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property describes the active or passive participation of instances of E39 Actors in an instance of E5 Event. 
It documents known events in which an instance of E39 Actor has participated during the course of that actor’s life or history. The instances of E53 Place and E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide constraints about the presence of the related instances of E39 Actor in the past. Collective actors, i.e. instances of E74 Group, may physically participate in events via their representing instances of E21 Persons only. The participation of multiple actors in an event is most likely an indication of their acquaintance and interaction.
The property implies that the actor was involved in the event but does not imply any causal relationship. For instance, someone having been portrayed can be said to have participated in the creation of the portrait.

Examples of the inverse property:
- Napoleon (E21) participated in The Battle of Waterloo (E7). (Dawson, 2018)
- Maria (E21) participated in Photographing of Maria (E7). (fictitious)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P11(x,y) ⇒ E5(x)
- P11(x,y) ⇒ E39(y) 
- P11(x,y) ⇒ P12(x,y)

Scope note:
This symmetric property associates an instance of E53 Place with another instance of E53 Place geometrically overlapping it. 
It does not specify anything about the shared area. This property is purely spatial. It does not imply that phenomena that define, by their extent, places related by P121 overlaps with have ever covered a common area at the same time or even coexisted. In contrast, spatiotemporal overlaps described by P132 spatiotemporally overlaps are the total of areas simultaneously covered by the related spacetime volumes.
This property is symmetric. This property is reflexive.

Examples:
- The territory of the United States as in 2020 (E53) overlaps with the Arctic (E53). (Gannett et al., 1904)
- The maximal extent of the Kingdom of Greece (1832-1973) (E53) overlaps with the maximal extent of the Republic of Turkey (29(th) October 1923 to now) (E53).

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property associates an instance of E7 Activity to an instance of E55 Type, which classifies an instance of E70 Thing used in an instance of E7 Activity, when the specific instance is either unknown or not of interest, such as use of “a hammer”.
This property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E7 Activity through P16 used specific object, E70 Thing, P2 has type, to E55 Type.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The English archers’ activity in the Battle of Agincourt (E7) used object of type long bow (E55). (Curry, 2015)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P125(x,y) ⇒ E7(x)
- P125(x,y) ⇒ E55(y)
- P125(x,y) ⇔ (∃z) [E70(z) ∧ P16(x,z) ∧ P2(z,y)]

Scope note:
This property identifies an instance E90 Symbolic Object carried by an instance of E18 Physical Thing. Since an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is defined as an immaterial idealization over potentially multiple carriers, any individual realization on a particular physical carrier may be defective, due to deterioration or shortcomings in the process of creating the realization compared to the intended ideal. As long as such defects do not substantially affect the complete recognition of the respective symbolic object, it is still regarded as carrying an instance of this E90 Symbolic Object. If these defects are of scholarly interest, the particular realization can be modelled as an instance of E25 Human-Made Feature. Note, that any instance of E90 Symbolic Object incorporated (P165) in the carried symbolic object is also carried by the same instance of E18 Physical Thing.

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property identifies an instance E90 Symbolic Object carried by an instance of E18 Physical Thing. Since an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is defined as an immaterial idealization over potentially multiple carriers, any individual realization on a particular physical carrier may be defective, due to deterioration or shortcomings in the process of creating the realization compared to the intended ideal. As long as such defects do not substantially affect the complete recognition of the respective symbolic object, it is still regarded as carrying an instance of this E90 Symbolic Object. If these defects are of scholarly interest, the particular realization can be modelled as an instance of E25 Human-Made Feature. Note, that any instance of E90 Symbolic Object incorporated (P165) in the carried symbolic object is also carried by the same instance of E18 Physical Thing.

Examples of the inverse property:
- Matthew’s paperback copy of Reach for the Sky (E18) carries the text of Reach for the Sky (E73). [see also: (Brickhill, 2001)] (fictitious)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P128(x,y) ⇒ E18(x)
- P128(x,y) ⇒ E90(y) 
- P128(x,y) ⇒ P130(x,y)

Scope note:
This property generalises the notions of “copy of” and “similar to” into a directed relationship, where the domain expresses the derivative or influenced item and the range the source or influencing item, if such a direction can be established. The property can also be used to express similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons. The property expresses a symmetric relationship in case no direction of influence can be established either from evidence on the item itself or from historical knowledge. This holds in particular for siblings of a derivation process from a common source or non-causal cultural parallels, such as some weaving patterns.
The P130.1 kind of similarity property of the P130 shows features of (features are also found on) property enables the relationship between the domain and the range to be further clarified, in the sense from domain to range, if applicable. For example, it may be expressed if both items are product “of the same mould”, or if two texts “contain identical paragraphs”. 
If the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e. that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. In these cases, P130 shows features of can be regarded as a shortcut of such a process. However, the current model does not contain any path specific enough to infer this property. Specializations of the CIDOC CRM may however be more explicit, for instance describing the use of moulds etc.
This property is not transitive. This property is irreflexive.

Examples:
- Mary Lamb’s Cymbeline from Charles and Mary Lamb’s Tales from Shakespeare (E89) shows features of William Shakespeare’s Cymbeline (E89). (Carrington, 1954)
- The audio recording of Dante Alighieri’s La divina commedia read by Enrico de Negri (E73) shows features of the text of Dante Alighieri’s La divina commedia (E89). (Alighieri, 1956)

Properties:
- P130.1 kind of similarity: E55 Type

In First Order Logic:
- P130(x,y) ⇒ E70(x)
- P130(x,y) ⇒ E70(y) 
- P130(x,y,z) ⇒ [P130(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]
- ¬P130(x,x)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property generalises the notions of “copy of” and “similar to” into a directed relationship, where the domain expresses the derivative or influenced item and the range the source or influencing item, if such a direction can be established. The property can also be used to express similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons. The property expresses a symmetric relationship in case no direction of influence can be established either from evidence on the item itself or from historical knowledge. This holds in particular for siblings of a derivation process from a common source or non-causal cultural parallels, such as some weaving patterns.
The P130.1 kind of similarity property of the P130 shows features of (features are also found on) property enables the relationship between the domain and the range to be further clarified, in the sense from domain to range, if applicable. For example, it may be expressed if both items are product “of the same mould”, or if two texts “contain identical paragraphs”. 
If the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e. that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. In these cases, P130 shows features of can be regarded as a shortcut of such a process. However, the current model does not contain any path specific enough to infer this property. Specializations of the CIDOC CRM may however be more explicit, for instance describing the use of moulds etc.
This property is not transitive. This property is irreflexive.

Examples of the inverse property:
- Mary Lamb’s Cymbeline from Charles and Mary Lamb’s Tales from Shakespeare (E89) shows features of William Shakespeare’s Cymbeline (E89). (Carrington, 1954)
- The audio recording of Dante Alighieri’s La divina commedia read by Enrico de Negri (E73) shows features of the text of Dante Alighieri’s La divina commedia (E89). (Alighieri, 1956)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P130(x,y) ⇒ E70(x)
- P130(x,y) ⇒ E70(y) 
- P130(x,y,z) ⇒ [P130(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]
- ¬P130(x,x)

This property associates two instances of E7 Activity, where the domain is considered as an intentional continuation of the range. A continuation of an activity may happen when the continued activity is still ongoing or after the continued activity has completely ended. The continuing activity may have started already before it decided to continue the other one. Continuation implies a coherence of intentions and outcomes of the involved activities.
This property is not transitive. This property is asymmetric.

Examples:
- The construction of the Kölner Dom (Cologne Cathedral), abandoned in the 15(th) century (E7), was continued by construction in the 19(th) century (E7). [The construction in the 19(th) century adapted the initial plans so as to preserve the intended appearance.] (Wolff, 1999)

Scope note:
This property establishes the relationship between an instance of E36 Visual Item and the instance of E1 CRM Entity that it visually represents.
Any entity may be represented visually. This property is part of the fully developed path from E24 Physical Human-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1 CRM Entity, which is shortcut by P62 depicts (is depicted by). P138.1 mode of representation allows the nature of the representation to be refined.
This property is also used for the relationship between an original and a digitisation of the original by the use of techniques such as digital photography, flatbed or infrared scanning. Digitisation is here seen as a process with a mechanical, causal component rendering the spatial distribution of structural and optical properties of the original and does not necessarily include any visual similarity identifiable by human observation.

- The digital file found at https://www.emunch.no/N/full/No-MM_N0001-01.jpg (E36) represents page 1 of Edward Munch's manuscript MM N 1, Munch-museet (E22) mode of representation Digitisation (E55).
- The 3D model VAM_A.200-1946_trace_1M.ply (E73) represents Victoria & Albert Museum’s Madonna and child sculpture (visual work) A.200-1946 (E22) mode of representation 3D surface (E55).

Properties:
- P138.1 mode of representation: E55 Type

In First Order Logic:
- P138(x,y) ⇒ E36(x)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property establishes the relationship between an instance of E36 Visual Item and the instance of E1 CRM Entity that it visually represents.
Any entity may be represented visually. This property is part of the fully developed path from E24 Physical Human-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1 CRM Entity, which is shortcut by P62 depicts (is depicted by). P138.1 mode of representation allows the nature of the representation to be refined.
This property is also used for the relationship between an original and a digitisation of the original by the use of techniques such as digital photography, flatbed or infrared scanning. Digitisation is here seen as a process with a mechanical, causal component rendering the spatial distribution of structural and optical properties of the original and does not necessarily include any visual similarity identifiable by human observation.

Examples of the inverse property:

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E41 Appellation with another instance of E41 Appellation that constitutes a derivative or variant of the former and that may also be used for identifying items identified by the former, in suitable contexts, independent from the particular item to be identified. This property should not be confused with additional variants of names used characteristically for a single, particular item, such as individual nicknames. It is a directed relationship, where the range expresses the derivative or variant and the domain the source of derivation or original form of variation, if such a direction can be established. Otherwise, the relationship is symmetric. 
Multiple names assigned to an object, which do not apply to all things identified with the specific instance of E41 Appellation, should be modelled as repeated values of P1 is identified by (identifies) of this object.
P139.1 has type allows the type of derivation to be refined, for instance “transliteration from Latin 1 to ASCII”.

Examples:
- “Martin Doerr” (E41) has alternative form “Martin Dörr” (E41) has type alternate spelling (E55).
- “Гончарова, Наталья Сергеевна” (E41) has alternative form \"Gončarova, Natal´â Sergeevna\" (E41) has type ISO 9:1995 transliteration (E55).
- “Αθήνα” (E41) has alternative form “Athina” (E41) has type transcription (E55).

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property associates an instance of E41 Appellation with another instance of E41 Appellation that constitutes a derivative or variant of the former and that may also be used for identifying items identified by the former, in suitable contexts, independent from the particular item to be identified. This property should not be confused with additional variants of names used characteristically for a single, particular item, such as individual nicknames. It is a directed relationship, where the range expresses the derivative or variant and the domain the source of derivation or original form of variation, if such a direction can be established. Otherwise, the relationship is symmetric. 
Multiple names assigned to an object, which do not apply to all things identified with the specific instance of E41 Appellation, should be modelled as repeated values of P1 is identified by (identifies) of this object.
P139.1 has type allows the type of derivation to be refined, for instance “transliteration from Latin 1 to ASCII”.

Examples of the inverse property:
- “Martin Doerr” (E41) has alternative form “Martin Dörr” (E41) has type alternate spelling (E55).
- “Гончарова, Наталья Сергеевна” (E41) has alternative form \"Gončarova, Natal´â Sergeevna\" (E41) has type ISO 9:1995 transliteration (E55).
- “Αθήνα” (E41) has alternative form “Athina” (E41) has type transcription (E55).

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P139(x,y) ⇒ E41(x)
- P139(x,y) ⇒ E41(y) 
- P139(x,y,z) ⇒ [P139(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]
- ¬P139(x,x)

The kind of attribution made should be documented using P177 assigned property of type (is type of property assigned).

Examples:
- The Current Ownership Assessment of Martin Doerr’s silver cup February 1997 (E13) assigned attribute to Martin Doerr’s silver cup (E22). (fictitious)
- The Identifier Assignment on 1(st) June 1997 of the silver cup donated by Martin Doerr (E15) assigned attribute to silver cup 232 (E22). (fictitious)
- The examination of MS Sinai Greek 418 (E13) assigned attribute to MS Sinai Greek 418 (E22). (Honey and Pickwoad, 2010)

Although a leaving activity normally concerns only one instance of E74 Group, it is possible to imagine circumstances under which leaving one E74 Group implies leaving another E74 Group as well.

Examples:
- The end of Sir Isaac Newton’s duty as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge to the Convention Parliament in 1702 (E86) separated from the Convention Parliament (E74). (Iliffe, 2013)
- George Washington’s leaving office in 1797 (E86) separated from the office of President of the United States (E74). (Unger, 2015)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property identifies the instance of E74 Group an instance of E39 Actor leaves through an instance of E86 Leaving.
Although a leaving activity normally concerns only one instance of E74 Group, it is possible to imagine circumstances under which leaving one E74 Group implies leaving another E74 Group as well.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The end of Sir Isaac Newton’s duty as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge to the Convention Parliament in 1702 (E86) separated from the Convention Parliament (E74). (Iliffe, 2013)
- George Washington’s leaving office in 1797 (E86) separated from the office of President of the United States (E74). (Unger, 2015)
- The implementation of the treaty regulating the termination of Greenland membership in EU between EU, Denmark and Greenland 1(st) February 1985 (E86) separated from EU (E74).

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P146(x,y) ⇒ E86(x)
- P146(x,y) ⇒ E74(y) 
- P146(x,y) ⇒ P11(x,y)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property associates an instance of E89 Propositional Object with a structural part of it that is by itself an instance of E89 Propositional Object.
This property is transitive. This property is asymmetric.

Examples of the inverse property:
- Dante’s “Divine Comedy” (E89) has component Dante’s “Hell” (E89). (Alighieri, 1956)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P148(x,y) ⇒ E89(x)
- P148(x,y) ⇒ E89(y)
- [P148(x,y) ∧ P148(y,z)] ⇒ P148(x,z)

Scope note:
This property describes the largest volume in space, an instance of E53 Place, that an instance of E18 Physical Thing has occupied at any time during its existence, with respect to the reference space relative to the physical thing itself. This allows for describing the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. The reference space for the associated place must be the one that is permanently at rest (P157 is at rest relative to) relative to the physical thing. For instances of E19 Physical Objects it is the one which is at rest relative to the object itself, i.e., which moves together with the object. For instances of E26 Physical Feature it is one which is at rest relative to the physical feature itself and the surrounding matter immediately connected to it. Therefore, there is a 1:1 relation between the instance E18 Physical Thing and the instance of E53 Place it occupies. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces. 
This property implies the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place. However, in contrast to P156 occupies, the property P161 has spatial projection does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place. 
In contrast to P156 occupies, for the property P53 has former or current location the following holds: 
It does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place. 
It identifies a possibly wider instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time-span. 
If the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place is not at rest with respect to the physical thing found there, the physical thing may move away after some time to another place and/or may have been at some other place before. The same holds for the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place.

Examples:
- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) occupies the space of the Saint Titus reliquary (E53). [The reliquary is currently kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966 and contains the skull of Saint Titus.] (Fisher & Garvey, 2010)
- Burg Eltz near Koblenz, Germany (E24) occupies the space within the 1661AD outer walls of Burg Eltz (E53). [The castle (English name: Eltz Castle) underwent a series of expansions starting in the 12(th) century until it reached its current extent in 1661AD and contains buildings from various periods.]

- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) occupies the space of the Saint Titus reliquary (E53). [The reliquary is currently kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966 and contains the skull of Saint Titus.] (Fisher & Garvey, 2010)
- Burg Eltz near Koblenz, Germany (E24) occupies the space within the 1661AD outer walls of Burg Eltz (E53). [The castle (English name: Eltz Castle) underwent a series of expansions starting in the 12(th) century until it reached its current extent in 1661AD and contains buildings from various periods.]

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume with an instance of E53 Place that is the result of the spatial projection of the instance of the E92 Spacetime Volume on a reference space.
In general, there can be more than one useful reference space (for reference space see P156 occupies and P157 is at rest relative to) to describe the spatial projection of a spacetime volume, for example, in describing a sea battle, the difference between the battle ship and the seafloor as reference spaces. Thus, it can be seen that the projection is not unique.
The spatial projection is the actual spatial coverage of a spacetime volume, which normally has fuzzy boundaries except for instances of E92 Spacetime Volume which are geometrically defined in the same reference system as the range of this property and are an exception to this and do not have fuzzy boundaries. Modelling explicitly fuzzy spatial projections serves therefore as a common topological reference of different spatial approximations rather than absolute geometric determination, for instance for relating outer or inner spatial boundaries for the respective spacetime volumes.
The spatial projection is unique with respect to the reference system. For instance, there is exactly one spatial projection of Lord Nelson’s dying relative to the ship HMS Victory, i.e. the location of his body relative to the ship HMS Victory at the time of his death.
In case the domain of an instance of P161 has spatial projection is an instance of E4 Period, the spatial projection describes all areas that period was ever present at, for instance, the Roman Empire. 
This property is part of the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place, which in turn is implied by P156 occupies (is occupied by).

Examples:
- The Roman Empire (E4) has spatial projection all areas ever claimed by Rome (E53). (Clare & Edwards, 1992)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property associates an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume with an instance of E53 Place that is the result of the spatial projection of the instance of the E92 Spacetime Volume on a reference space.
In general, there can be more than one useful reference space (for reference space see P156 occupies and P157 is at rest relative to) to describe the spatial projection of a spacetime volume, for example, in describing a sea battle, the difference between the battle ship and the seafloor as reference spaces. Thus, it can be seen that the projection is not unique.
The spatial projection is the actual spatial coverage of a spacetime volume, which normally has fuzzy boundaries except for instances of E92 Spacetime Volume which are geometrically defined in the same reference system as the range of this property and are an exception to this and do not have fuzzy boundaries. Modelling explicitly fuzzy spatial projections serves therefore as a common topological reference of different spatial approximations rather than absolute geometric determination, for instance for relating outer or inner spatial boundaries for the respective spacetime volumes.
The spatial projection is unique with respect to the reference system. For instance, there is exactly one spatial projection of Lord Nelson’s dying relative to the ship HMS Victory, i.e. the location of his body relative to the ship HMS Victory at the time of his death.
In case the domain of an instance of P161 has spatial projection is an instance of E4 Period, the spatial projection describes all areas that period was ever present at, for instance, the Roman Empire. 
This property is part of the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place, which in turn is implied by P156 occupies (is occupied by).

Examples of the inverse property:
- The Roman Empire (E4) has spatial projection all areas ever claimed by Rome (E53). (Clare & Edwards, 1992)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E73 Information Object with an instance of E90 Symbolic Object (or any of its subclasses) that was included in it.
This property makes it possible to recognise the autonomous status of the incorporated signs, which were created in a distinct context, and can be incorporated in many instances of E73 Information Object, and to highlight the difference between structural and accidental whole-part relationships between conceptual entities.
It accounts for many cultural facts that are quite frequent and significant: the inclusion of a poem in an anthology, the re-use of an operatic aria in a new opera, the use of a reproduction of a painting for a book cover or a CD booklet, the integration of textual quotations, the presence of lyrics in a song that sets those lyrics to music, the presence of the text of a play in a movie based on that play, etc.
In particular, this property allows for modelling relationships of different levels of symbolic specificity, such as the natural language words making up a particular text, the characters making up the words and punctuation, the choice of fonts and page layout for the characters.
When restricted to information objects, that is, seen as a property with E73 Information Object as domain and range the property is transitive.
A digital photograph of a manuscript page incorporates the text of a manuscript page, if the respective text is defined as a sequence of symbols of a particular type, such as Latin characters, and the resolution and quality of the digital image is sufficient to resolve these symbols so they are readable on the digital image.
This property is asymmetric.

Examples:
- The content of Charles-Moïse Briquet’s ‘Les Filigranes: dictionnaire historique des marques du papier’ (E32) incorporates the visual aspect of the watermark used around 1358-61 by some Spanish papermaker(s) and identified as ‘Briquet 4019’ (E37). (Briquet, 1985)
- The visual content of Jacopo Amigoni’s painting known as ‘The Singer Farinelli and friends’ (E36) incorporates the musical notation of Farinelli’s musical work entitled ‘La Partenza’ (E73). (National Gallery of Victoria)
- The visual content of Nicolas Poussin’s painting entitled ‘Les Bergers d’Arcadie’ (E36) incorporates the Latin phrase ‘Et in Arcadia ego’ (E33). (Wikipedia, 2020)

In First Order Logic:
- P165(x,y) ⇒ E73(x)

Scope note:
This property describes the use of material or immaterial things in a way essential to the performance or the outcome of an instance of E7 Activity. 
This property typically applies to tools, instruments, moulds, raw materials and items embedded in a product. It implies that the presence of the object in question was a necessary condition for the action. For example, the activity of writing this text required the use of a computer. An immaterial thing can be used if at least one of its carriers is present. For example, the software tools on a computer.
Another example is the use of a particular name by a particular group of people over some span to identify a thing, such as a settlement. In this case, the physical carriers of this name are at least the people understanding its use.

Examples:
- The writing of the scope note of the CIDOC CRM property “P16 used specific object” contained in the CIDOC CRM version 4.1 (E7) used specific object Nicholas Crofts’ computer (E22) mode of use Typing Tool; Storage Medium (E55). [the original scope note was later extended in the CIDOC CRM version 4.3] 
- The people of Iraq calling the place identified by TGN ‘7017998’ (E7) used specific object “Quyunjig” (E41) mode of use current; vernacular (E55).

Properties:
- P16.1 mode of use: E55 Type

- P16(x,y) ⇒ P12(x,y)
- P16(x,y) ⇒ P15(x,y)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property describes the use of material or immaterial things in a way essential to the performance or the outcome of an instance of E7 Activity. 
This property typically applies to tools, instruments, moulds, raw materials and items embedded in a product. It implies that the presence of the object in question was a necessary condition for the action. For example, the activity of writing this text required the use of a computer. An immaterial thing can be used if at least one of its carriers is present. For example, the software tools on a computer.
Another example is the use of a particular name by a particular group of people over some span to identify a thing, such as a settlement. In this case, the physical carriers of this name are at least the people understanding its use.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The writing of the scope note of the CIDOC CRM property “P16 used specific object” contained in the CIDOC CRM version 4.1 (E7) used specific object Nicholas Crofts’ computer (E22) mode of use Typing Tool; Storage Medium (E55). [the original scope note was later extended in the CIDOC CRM version 4.3] 
- The people of Iraq calling the place identified by TGN ‘7017998’ (E7) used specific object “Quyunjig” (E41) mode of use current; vernacular (E55).

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P16(x,y) ⇒ E7(x)
- P16(x,y) ⇒ E70(y)
- P16(x,y) ⇒ P12(x,y)
- P16(x,y) ⇒ P15(x,y)
- P16(x,y,z) ⇒ [P16(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]

Examples:
- The legendary run from Marathon to Athens 490BC (E7) starts before or with the end of The Battle of Marathon 490BC (E7).
- LMIIB (E4) ends after or with the start of the Tutankhamun period (1332-1323 B.C.E.) (E4). [Evidence for this is provided by the scarab seal found at Poros in a context of LMIIB. The scarab belongs to the type “nh.s n Jmn”. During the Akhenaten period he production of these scarab seals stopped (the name of Amun is not referred to during his reign). So the scarab could not have been produced before the Tutankhamun period and is probably a later production.] (Karetsou, 2000)

This property corresponds to a disjunction (logical OR) of the following Allen temporal relations (Allen, 1983): {before, meets, overlaps, starts, started-by, contains, finishes, finished-by, equals, during, overlapped by}
Typically, this property is a consequence of a known influence of some event on another event or activity, such as a novel written by someone being continued by someone else, or the knowledge of a defeat on a distant battlefield causing people to end their ongoing activities.

Examples:
- The production of the scarab seal found in Poros in a context of LMIIIB (E12) starts after or with the start of Tutankhamun period (1332-1323 B.C) (E4). [The scarab stamp seal found in Poros was associated with finds dated to the LMIIIB period. The seal is dated to the Tutankhamun period or later because it belongs to the scarabs of type “nh.s n Jmn”: During Akhenaten period, the production of this type of scarab seal stopped (the name of Amun is not referred to during his reign). Therefore, the scarab cannot have been produced before the Tutankhamun period and is probably a later production] (Karetsou, 2000)
- The production of the cylindrical seal of the first Dynasty of Babylon found in Tholos B in Platanos (E12) starts after or with the start of the Hammurabi period of the kingdom (E4). [Of the cylindrical seal of the first Dynasty of Babylon found in tholos B in Platanos believed to connect king Hammurabi with the MM I period. Specifically, although the finding is believed to have been found in a MM I layer, it contained material from the MM III/YM I period. Therefore, the seal may be from the Hammurabi period or, it may be from a later period.] (Walberg, 1992.)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property specifies that the temporal extent of the domain instance A of E2 Temporal Entity starts before or simultaneously with the start of the temporal extent of the range instance B of E2 Temporal Entity. 
In other words, if A = [A(start), A(end)] and B = [B(start), B(end)], it means A(start) ≤ B(start) is true.
This property is part of the set of temporal primitives P173 – P176, P182 – P185.
This property corresponds to a disjunction (logical OR) of the following Allen temporal relations (Allen, 1983): {before, meets, overlaps, starts, started-by, contains, finished-by, equals}
In a model with fuzzy borders, this property will not be transitive.
This property is irreflexive.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The production of the scarab seal found in Poros in a context of LMIIIB (E12) starts after or with the start of Tutankhamun period (1332-1323 B.C) (E4). [The scarab stamp seal found in Poros was associated with finds dated to the LMIIIB period. The seal is dated to the Tutankhamun period or later because it belongs to the scarabs of type “nh.s n Jmn”: During Akhenaten period, the production of this type of scarab seal stopped (the name of Amun is not referred to during his reign). Therefore, the scarab cannot have been produced before the Tutankhamun period and is probably a later production] (Karetsou, 2000)
- The production of the cylindrical seal of the first Dynasty of Babylon found in Tholos B in Platanos (E12) starts after or with the start of the Hammurabi period of the kingdom (E4). [Of the cylindrical seal of the first Dynasty of Babylon found in tholos B in Platanos believed to connect king Hammurabi with the MM I period. Specifically, although the finding is believed to have been found in a MM I layer, it contained material from the MM III/YM I period. Therefore, the seal may be from the Hammurabi period or, it may be from a later period.] (Walberg, 1992.)

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment with the type of property or relation that this assignment maintains to hold between the item to which it assigns an attribute and the attribute itself. Note that the properties defined by the CIDOC CRM also constitute instances of E55 Type themselves. The direction of the assigned property of type is understood to be from the attributed item (the range of property P140 assigned attribute to) to the attribute item (the range of the property P141 assigned). More than one property type may be assigned to hold between two items.
A comprehensive explanation about refining CIDOC CRM concepts by E55 Type is given in the section “About Types” in the section on “Specific Modelling Constructs” of this document.

Examples:
- The Current Ownership Assessment of Martin Doerr’s silver cup February 1997 (E13) assigned property of type P52 has former or current owner (is former or current keeper of) (E55). (fictitious)
- 1(st) June 1997 Identifier Assignment of the silver cup donated by Martin Doerr (E15) assigned property of type P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of) (E55). (fictitious)
- The examination of MS Sinai Greek 418 (E13) assigned property of type binding structure type (E55). [‘binding structure type’ refers to a property, external to the CIDOC CRM, which connects a book (E22) to the type of its binding structure (E55)] (Honey & Pickwoad, 2010)
- The condition assessment of the endband cores of MS Sinai Greek 418 (E14) assigned property of type damage (E55). [‘damage’ refers to a property, external to the CIDOC CRM, which connects an instance of a physical thing like an endband core (E22) to the type of damage (E55) it shows] (Honey & Pickwoad, 2010)
- The condition assessment of the cover of MS Sinai Greek 418 (E14) assigned property of type quality (E55). [‘quality’ refers to a property, external to the CIDOC CRM, which connects an instance of a physical thing like a book cover (E22) to its quality (E55)] (Honey and Pickwoad, 2010)

[“The site at Lerna probably was not left uninhabited for long after the destruction of the House of the Tiles and the raising of the tumulus. If there was a gap corresponding to the earliest stage of EH III in the Argolid, as has been suggested by some (see, e.g., Manning 1995: 55–60), it was a brief one.

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E53 Place with another instance of E53 Place, which is defined in the same reference space, and which is used to approximate the former. The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.
In common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g. in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g. if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as an approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge. 
In more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature. If the methodology is known a maximum deviation from the measured point can be calculated and the encounter spot or feature may be related to the resulting circle using an instance of P171 at some place within.
This property is not transitive. This property is reflexive.

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E18 Physical Thing with the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume that constitutes the complete trajectory of its geometric extent through spacetime for the whole time of the existence of the instance of E18 Physical Thing.
An instance of E18 Physical Thing not only occupies a particular geometric space at each instant of its existence, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime, i.e. the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume this property associates it with. This real spatiotemporal extent of the instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded as being unique, in all its details and fuzziness; the identity and existence of the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume depend uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing, whose existence defines it. It constitutes a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013).
Included in this spacetime volume are both the spaces filled by the matter of the physical thing and any inner space that may exist, for instance the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a finite number of individually contiguous subsets of this spacetime volume equal to the number of objects that constitute the set and that are never connected during its existence.

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property associates an instance of E18 Physical Thing with the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume that constitutes the complete trajectory of its geometric extent through spacetime for the whole time of the existence of the instance of E18 Physical Thing.
An instance of E18 Physical Thing not only occupies a particular geometric space at each instant of its existence, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime, i.e. the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume this property associates it with. This real spatiotemporal extent of the instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded as being unique, in all its details and fuzziness; the identity and existence of the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume depend uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing, whose existence defines it. It constitutes a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013).
Included in this spacetime volume are both the spaces filled by the matter of the physical thing and any inner space that may exist, for instance the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a finite number of individually contiguous subsets of this spacetime volume equal to the number of objects that constitute the set and that are never connected during its existence.

Examples of the inverse property:
- H.M.S. Temeraire (E22) defines the spacetime volume of H.M.S. Temeraire (E92). [it was built, during 1798, in Chatham and destroyed, during 1838, in Rotherhithe] (Willis, 2010)
- The Saint Titus reliquary (E22) defines the spacetime volume of the Saint Titus reliquary (E92). [the reliquary has been produced by the workshop of the Vogiatzis brothers located at Monastiraki, Athens, in 1966 as container for the skull of Saint Titus, which was placed into it at that time and has since then continued to fall within the container’s spacetime volume. The reliquary with the skull has been kept in the Saint Titus Church in Heraklion, Crete since 1966] (Fisher & Garvey, 2010; Panotis, 2016)

Scope note:
This property relates one instance of E18 Physical Thing which acts as a container or support to a supported or contained instance of E18 Physical Thing. Typical examples of E18 Physical Things which are intended to function as a container or support include shelves, folders or boxes. These containers or supports provide a stable surface which is intended for other physical objects to be placed upon for storage, display, transport or other similar functions.
This property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P59 has section, E53 Place, P53i is former or current location of, to E18 Physical Thing. It is not a sub-property of P46 is composed of, as the held or supported object is not a component of the container or support.
This property can be used to avoid explicitly instantiating the E53 Place which is defined by an instance of E18 Physical Thing, especially when the only intended use of that instance of E18 Physical Thing is to act as a container or surface for the storage of other instances of E18 Physical Thing. The place’s existence is defined by the existence of the container or surface, and will go out of existence at the same time as the destruction of the container or surface. 
This property is transitive. This property is asymmetric.

Examples:
- Archival folder “6” (E22) holds or supports the piece of paper carrying the text of a letter from Lawrence Alloway to Sylvia Sleigh (E22).

This is distinct from the intended use of an item in some general type of activity such as the book of common prayer which was intended for use in Church of England services (see P101 had as general use (was use of)).

Examples of the inverse property:
- Lady Diana Spencer’s wedding dress (E71) was made for Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer (E7) mode of use To Be Worn (E55). (Daly, 1981)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P19(x,y) ⇒ E7(x)
- P19(x,y) ⇒ E71(y)
- P19(x,y,z) ⇒ [P19(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]

Scope note:
This property describes the naming or identification of any real-world item by a name or any other identifier. 
This property is intended for identifiers in general use, which form part of the world the model intends to describe, and not merely for internal database identifiers which are specific to a technical system, unless these latter also have a more general use outside the technical context. This property includes in particular identification by mathematical expressions such as coordinate systems used for the identification of instances of E53 Place. The property does not reveal anything about when, where and by whom this identifier was used. A more detailed representation can be made using the fully developed (i.e. indirect) path through E15 Identifier Assignment.
This property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P140i was attributed by, E15 Identifier Assignment, P37 assigned to E42 Identifier. 
It is also a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P1 is identified by, E41 Appellation, P139 has alternative form to E41 Appellation.

Examples:
- The capital of Italy (E53) is identified by “Rome” (E41). (Leach, 2017)
- Text 25014–32 (E33) is identified by “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” (E35). (Gibbon, 2013)

P20 had specific purpose (was purpose of) implies that the activity succeeded in achieving its aim. If it does not succeed, such as the setting of a trap that did not catch anything, the unrealized intention should be documented using P21 had general purpose (was purpose of): E55 Type and/or P33 used specific technique (was used by): E29 Design or Procedure.

Examples:
- Van Eyck’s pigment grinding in 1432 (E7) had specific purpose the painting of the Ghent altar piece (E12). (Borchert, 2008)

In First Order Logic:
- P20(x,y) ⇒ E7(x)
- P20(x,y) ⇒ E5(y)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property describes an intentional relationship between an instance of E7 Activity and some general goal or purpose, described as an instance of E55 Type. 
This may involve activities intended as preparation for some type of activity or event. P21 had general purpose (was purpose of) differs from P20 had specific purpose (was purpose of in that no specific event is implied as the purpose.

Examples of the inverse property:
- Van Eyck’s pigment grinding (E7) had general purpose painting (E55). (Borchert, 2008)
- The setting of trap 2742 on 17(th) May 1874 (E7) had general purpose catching moose (E55). [activity type] (fictitious)
- The construction of the Berlin Wall starting 13(th) August 1961 (E12) had general purpose preventing emigration (E55). (History.com Editors, 2020)
- The reinforcement of the Mexico-United States barrier between the United States of America and Mexico in Fall 2019 (E11) had general purpose preventing immigration (E55).
- The rebuilding of the city walls of Heraklion by the Venetian rulers starting in 1462 (E12) had general purpose preventing conquest by enemy (E55). (YouIngGreece.com, 2020)
- The building of the seawall in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan between 2014 and 2020 (E12) had general purpose preventing inland flooding by tsunami (E55).

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P21(x,y) ⇒ E7(x)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property identifies an origin, an instance of E53 Place, of an instance of E9 Move.
A move will be linked to an origin, such as the move of an artifact from storage to display. A move may be linked to many starting instances of E53 Place by multiple instances of this property. In this case the move describes the picking up of a set of objects. The area of the move includes the origin(s), route and destination(s).
Therefore, the described origin is an instance of E53 Place which P89 falls within (contains) the instance of E53 Place the move P7 took place at.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The movement of the exhibition “Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh” between 15(th) September and 2(nd) November 2019 (E9) moved from Paris, Grande Halle de la Villette (E53).

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P27(x,y) ⇒ E9(x)
- P27(x,y) ⇒ E53(y) 
- P27(x,y) ⇒ (∃z) [E53(z) ∧ P7(x,z) ∧ P89(y,z)]

Scope note:
This property allows sub-typing of CIDOC CRM entities –a form of specialisation – through the use of a terminological hierarchy, or thesaurus. 
The CIDOC CRM is intended to focus on the high-level entities and relationships needed to describe data structures. Consequently, it does not specialise entities any further than is required for this immediate purpose. However, entities in the isA hierarchy of the CIDOC CRM may by specialised into any number of sub-entities, which can be defined in the E55 Type hierarchy. E41 Appellation, for example, may be specialised into “e-mail address”, “telephone number”, “post office box”, “URL”, etc., none of which figures explicitly in the CIDOC CRM class hierarchy. A comprehensive explanation about refining CIDOC CRM concepts by E55 Type is given in the section “About Types” in the section on “Specific Modelling Constructs” of this document.
This property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P41i was classified by, E17 Type Assignment, P42 assigned to E55 Type.

Examples:
- “enquiries@cidoc-crm.org” (E41) has type e-mail address (E55). (fictitious)

In First Order Logic:
- P2(x,y) ⇒ E1(x)
- P2(x,y) ⇒ E55(y)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property allows sub-typing of CIDOC CRM entities –a form of specialisation – through the use of a terminological hierarchy, or thesaurus. 
The CIDOC CRM is intended to focus on the high-level entities and relationships needed to describe data structures. Consequently, it does not specialise entities any further than is required for this immediate purpose. However, entities in the isA hierarchy of the CIDOC CRM may by specialised into any number of sub-entities, which can be defined in the E55 Type hierarchy. E41 Appellation, for example, may be specialised into “e-mail address”, “telephone number”, “post office box”, “URL”, etc., none of which figures explicitly in the CIDOC CRM class hierarchy. A comprehensive explanation about refining CIDOC CRM concepts by E55 Type is given in the section “About Types” in the section on “Specific Modelling Constructs” of this document.
This property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P41i was classified by, E17 Type Assignment, P42 assigned to E55 Type.

Examples of the inverse property:
- “enquiries@cidoc-crm.org” (E41) has type e-mail address (E55). (fictitious)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property identifies a specific instance of E29 Design or Procedure in order to carry out an instance of E7 Activity or parts of it. 
The property differs from P32 used general technique (was technique of) in that P33 refers to an instance of E29 Design or Procedure, which is a concrete information object in its own right rather than simply being a term or a method known by tradition. 
Typical examples would include intervention plans for conservation or the construction plans of a building.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The ornamentation of silver cup 232 (E11) used specific technique ‘Instructions for golden chase work by A N Other’ (E29). (fictitious)
- The rebuilding of the German Reichstag in Berlin (E11) used specific technique Architectural plans by Foster and Partners (E29). (Foster, 2000)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P33(x,y) ⇒ E7(x)
- P33(x,y) ⇒ E29(y)
- P33(x,y) ⇒ P16(x,y)

Scope note:
This property records the dimension that was observed in an E16 Measurement Event.
E54 Dimension can be any quantifiable aspect of E70 Thing. Weight, image colour depth and monetary value are dimensions in this sense. One measurement activity may determine more than one dimension of one object.
Dimensions may be determined either by direct observation or using recorded evidence. In the latter case the measured Thing does not need to be present or extant.
Even though knowledge of the value of a dimension requires measurement, the dimension may be an object of discourse prior to, or even without, any measurement being made.

Examples:
- The measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (E16) observed dimension silver cup 232 height (E54). [which has unit mm (E58), has value 224 (E60)] (fictitious)
- The carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 (E16) observed dimension the carbon 14 based temporal distance from 1996 to the growth of the wood of the “Schoeninger Speer II” (E60).

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property records the dimension that was observed in an E16 Measurement Event.
E54 Dimension can be any quantifiable aspect of E70 Thing. Weight, image colour depth and monetary value are dimensions in this sense. One measurement activity may determine more than one dimension of one object.
Dimensions may be determined either by direct observation or using recorded evidence. In the latter case the measured Thing does not need to be present or extant.
Even though knowledge of the value of a dimension requires measurement, the dimension may be an object of discourse prior to, or even without, any measurement being made.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (E16) observed dimension silver cup 232 height (E54). [which has unit mm (E58), has value 224 (E60)] (fictitious)
- The carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 (E16) observed dimension the carbon 14 based temporal distance from 1996 to the growth of the wood of the “Schoeninger Speer II” (E60). [The carbon 14 dating of an approximately 400.000 year old complete Old Palaeolithic wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niederachsen, Germany, in 1995. See also: E16 Measurement.] (Kouwenhoven, 1997)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P40(x,y) ⇒ E16(x)
- P40(x,y)⇒ E54(y)
- P40(x,y) ⇒ P141(x,y)

This property records an instance of E54 Dimension of some instance of E70 Thing.
In the case that the recorded property is a result of a measurement of an instance of E18 Physical Thing, this property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P39i was measured by, E16 Measurement, P40 observed dimension to E54 Dimension. 
It offers no information about how and when an E54 Dimension was established, nor by whom.

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E18 Physical Thing with another instance of Physical Thing that forms part of it. The spatial extent of the composing part is included in the spatial extent of the whole.
Component elements, since they are themselves instances of E18 Physical Thing, may be further analysed into sub-components, thereby creating a hierarchy of part decomposition. An instance of E18 Physical Thing may be shared between multiple wholes, for example two buildings may share a common wall. This property does not specify when and for how long a component element resided in the respective whole. If a component is not part of a whole from the beginning of existence or until the end of existence of the whole, the classes E79 Part Addition and E90 Part Removal can be used to document when a component became part of a particular whole and/or when it stopped being a part of it. For the time-span of being part of the respective whole, the component is completely contained in the place the whole occupies.
This property is intended to describe specific components that are individually documented, rather than general aspects. Overall descriptions of the structure of an instance of E18 Physical Thing are captured by the P3 has note property.
The instances of E57 Material of which an instance of E18 Physical Thing is composed should be documented using P45 consists of (is incorporated in).
This property is transitive and asymmetric.

Examples:
- The Royal carriage (E22) forms part of the Royal train (E22).
- The “Hog’s Back” (E24) forms part of the “Fosseway” (E24).

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property associates an instance of E18 Physical Thing with another instance of Physical Thing that forms part of it. The spatial extent of the composing part is included in the spatial extent of the whole.
Component elements, since they are themselves instances of E18 Physical Thing, may be further analysed into sub-components, thereby creating a hierarchy of part decomposition. An instance of E18 Physical Thing may be shared between multiple wholes, for example two buildings may share a common wall. This property does not specify when and for how long a component element resided in the respective whole. If a component is not part of a whole from the beginning of existence or until the end of existence of the whole, the classes E79 Part Addition and E90 Part Removal can be used to document when a component became part of a particular whole and/or when it stopped being a part of it. For the time-span of being part of the respective whole, the component is completely contained in the place the whole occupies.
This property is intended to describe specific components that are individually documented, rather than general aspects. Overall descriptions of the structure of an instance of E18 Physical Thing are captured by the P3 has note property.
The instances of E57 Material of which an instance of E18 Physical Thing is composed should be documented using P45 consists of (is incorporated in).
This property is transitive and asymmetric.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The Royal carriage (E22) forms part of the Royal train (E22).
- The “Hog’s Back” (E24) forms part of the “Fosseway” (E24).

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P46(x,y) ⇒ E18(x)
- P46(x,y) ⇒ E18(y)
- P46(x,y) ⇒ P132(x,y)

Scope note:
This property describes the decomposition of an instance of E3 Condition State into discrete, subsidiary states. 
It is assumed that the sub-states into which the condition state is analysed form a logical whole, although the entire story may not be completely known, and that the sub-states are in fact constitutive of the general condition state. For example, a general condition state of “in ruins” may be decomposed into the individual stages of decay. 
This property is transitive and asymmetric.

Examples:
- The Condition State of the ruined Parthenon (E3) consists of the bombarded state after the explosion of a Venetian shell in 1687 (E3). (Mommsen, 1941)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property describes the decomposition of an instance of E3 Condition State into discrete, subsidiary states. 
It is assumed that the sub-states into which the condition state is analysed form a logical whole, although the entire story may not be completely known, and that the sub-states are in fact constitutive of the general condition state. For example, a general condition state of “in ruins” may be decomposed into the individual stages of decay. 
This property is transitive and asymmetric.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The Condition State of the ruined Parthenon (E3) consists of the bombarded state after the explosion of a Venetian shell in 1687 (E3). (Mommsen, 1941)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P5(x,y) ⇒ E3(x)
- P5(x,y) ⇒ E3(y)
- [P5(x,y) ∧ P5(y,z)] ⇒ P5(x,z)
- P5(x,y) ⇒ ¬P5(y,x)

Scope note:
This property generalises relationships like whole-part, sequence, prerequisite or inspired by between instances of E29 Design or Procedure. Any instance of E29 Design or Procedure may be associated with other designs or procedures. The property is considered to be symmetrical unless otherwise indicated by P69.1 has type. The property is not transitive.
This property is a directed relationship. The P69.1 has type property of P69 has association with allows the nature of the association to be specified reading from domain to range; examples of types of association between instances of E29 Design or Procedure include: has part, follows, requires, etc.
Instances of this property are considered to be symmetric, in case no directed sense is provided for them by the property P69.1 has type.
The property can typically be used to model the decomposition of the description of a complete workflow into a series of separate procedures.

Examples:
- The procedure for glass blowing (E29) has association with the procedure for glass heating (E29). (Brooks, 1973)
- The set of instructions for performing Macbeth in Max Reinhardt's production in 1916 in Berlin at Deutsches Theater (E29) has association with the scene design drawing by Ernst Stern reproduced at http://www.glopad.org/pi/fr/record/digdoc/1003814 (E29) has type has part (E55).
- The preparation of parchment (E29) has association with soaking and unhairing of skin (E29) has type has part (E55).
- Stretching of skin (E29) has association with soaking and unhairing of skin (E29) has type follows (E55). (Poole and Reed, 1962)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property describes the CRM Entities documented as instances of E31 Document. 
Documents may describe any conceivable entity, hence the link to the highest-level entity in the CIDOC CRM class hierarchy. This property is intended for cases where a reference is regarded as making a proposition about reality. This may be of a documentary character, in the scholarly or scientific sense, or a more general statement.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The ‘Catalogue of the Greek coins of Arabia, Mesopotamia and Persia’ (E31) documents parts of the British Museum’s Collection (E78). (British Museum & Hill, 1922)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property links an instance of E33 Linguistic Object (A), to another instance of E33 Linguistic Object (B) which is the translation of A.
When an instance of E33 Linguistic Object is translated into a new language a new instance of E33 Linguistic Object is created, despite the translation being conceptually similar to the source.
This property is asymmetric.

Examples of the inverse property:
- “Les Baigneurs” (E33) has translation “The Bathers” (E33). (Spiers & Surenne, 1854)

Scope note:
This property describes the spatial location of an instance of E4 Period. 
The related instance of E53 Place should be seen as a wider approximation of the geometric area within which the phenomena that characterise the period in question occurred, see below. P7 took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.
Any place where something happened includes the spatial projection of the happening given in the same geometric reference system. For instance, HMS Victory, as place of Lord Nelson's dying, includes the location of his body relative to the hull of HMS Victory at his time of death as the most precise location of his death. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection, an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections to respective reference systems, that is, instances of E53 Place. Therefore, this property implies the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place, where both places are defined in the same geometric reference system. The relation between an instance of E53 Place and its reference system can conveniently be documented via the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).
Something that has happened at a given place can also be considered to have happened at a smaller place within it: for example, it is reasonable to say Caesar’s murder took place in Rome, but also on the Forum Romanum, and more precisely in the Curia. It is characteristic for different historical sources to use varying precision in such statements, without being in contradiction with each other. This may be due to lack of knowledge or to the relevance of the precision for the purpose of the statement. In information integration, the more precise statement improves the overall knowledge.

- The period “Révolution française” (E4) took place at the area covered by France in 1789 (E53). (Bertaud, 2004)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property identifies an instance of E53 Place that falls wholly within the extent of another instance of E53 Place.
It addresses spatial containment only and does not imply any relationship between things or phenomena occupying these places.
This property is transitive and reflexive.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The area covered by the World Heritage Site of Stonehenge (E53) falls within the area of Salisbury Plain (E53). (Pryor, 2016)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- P89(x,y) ⇒ E53(x)
- P89(x,y) ⇒ E53(y)
- [P89(x,y) ∧ P89(y,z)] ⇒ P89(x,z)

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property identifies the S22 Segment of Matter that was destroyed through an A1 Excavation Processing Unit. The spatial extent of the instance of S22 Segment of Matter is defined by the extent of the spatial 3-dimensional projection of the A1 Excavation Processing Unit. Depending on the granularity of the documented instance of A1 Excavation Processing Unit, different instances of S22 Segment of Matter may be identified by the A10 property.

Examples of the inverse property:
- The complete excavation of Villa of the Mysteries in Pompeii, Italy (A1) destroyed the stratum of ash, pumice, and other volcanic material (S22). (Maiuri, 1931)

Scope note:
This property identifies the physical relationship between two A8 Stratigraphic Units. The described relationship may be between two adjacent instances of A2 Stratigraphic Volume Unit sharing a common interface (instance of A3 Stratigraphic Interface), between an instance of A2 Stratigraphic Volume Unit and one of its adjacent interfaces, such as human-made cuts or earthquake induced faults, or even between two intersecting interfaces.
The type of physical relationships found between stratigraphic units in archaeological or geological documentation is documented through the property AP11.1 has type. The type applies to the direction from the domain to the range of the property AP11 has physical relation to (is physically related from). The type of physical relationship typically constitutes strong evidence for the sequence of genesis of the related stratigraphic units, which can be documented by the property AP13 has stratigraphic relation to (is stratigraphically related by). The type may either pertain to a relative topology, such as the one being “under” the other, or to the fine-structure of the interface between them, such as a layer of concrete having filled out earlier micro-cavities in various directions in the interface before solidifying.

Examples:
- The layer of burned remains of the log building in Søndre gate, Trondheim, Norway, (A8) has physical relation to under the foundation of the church of St. Clements (A8). (Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research, 2018)
- The floors at B of the building 1 in Çatalhöyük, Turkey (A8) has physical relation to wall C (A8) has type runs up to (E55) [as observed initially] (Hodder, 1999)
- The wall C of the building 1 in Çatalhöyük, Turkey (A8) has physical relation to the floors at B (A8) has type inserted by cut (E55) [as observed finally] (Hodder, 1999)
- The wall C of the building 1 in Çatalhöyük, Turkey (A8) has physical relation to wall D (A8) has type abuts on (E55). (Hodder, 1999)
- The wall D of the building 1 in Çatalhöyük, Turkey (A8) has physical relation to the floors at B (A8) has type on top of (E55). (Hodder, 1999)

Scope note:
This property identifies the stratigraphic relation between two A5 Stratigraphic Modification events. This relation may be inferred from the kind of physical relation that exists between the two AP 8 Stratigraphic Units that have been created or modified during the corresponding A5 Stratigraphic Modification events. The type of stratigraphic relationships in archaeological documentation assigned to two A5 Stratigraphic Modification events is documented through the property AP 13.1 has type.

Examples:
- The burning of the log building in Søndre gate, Trondheim, Norway, (A5) has stratigraphic relation to the laying of the foundation for the church of St. Clements (A5) has type earlier (E55). (Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research, 2018)
- The production of the floors at B of the building 1 in Çatalhöyük, Turkey (E12) has stratigraphic relation to the production of wall C (E12) has type after (E55). [as observed initially, see AP11] (Hodder, 1999)
- The production of wall C of the building 1 in Çatalhöyük, Turkey (A5) has stratigraphic relation to the production of the floors at B (A5) has type after (E55). [as observed finally, see AP11] (Hodder,, 1999)
- The production of the wall C of the building 1 in Çatalhöyük, Turkey (A5) has stratigraphic relation to the production of wall D (A5) has type after (E55). [See AP11] (Hodder, 1999)
- The production of the wall D of the building 1 in Çatalhöyük, Turkey (A5) has stratigraphic relation to the production of the floors B’ (A5) has type after (E55). [See AP11] (Hodder, 1999)

Properties:

Scope note:
This property associates a kind of object (documented as an instance of E55 Type) with an instance of E4 Period indicating that objects of this kind have been generated in this period in significantly greater numbers and in wider distributions, than in other periods. This property makes a moderate statement concerning the distribution of the associated object kind in the observed record: If a \"sufficient number\" of objects of this type are found in a context, and their genesis can plausibly be assumed to fall within the genesis of the find context, then the statement made with this property would support reasoning, ceteris paribus, that the genesis period of the find context is likely to form part of the related instance of E4 Period, or at least overlap with it. “Sufficient number” means that the density of objects of this kind in the find context is compatible with the general density that this kind of object had during the associated period in contexts of a comparable nature and deposition history.

Scope note of the inverse property:
This property associates a kind of object (documented as an instance of E55 Type) with an instance of E4 Period indicating that objects of this kind have been generated in this period in significantly greater numbers and in wider distributions, than in other periods. This property makes a moderate statement concerning the distribution of the associated object kind in the observed record: If a \"sufficient number\" of objects of this type are found in a context, and their genesis can plausibly be assumed to fall within the genesis of the find context, then the statement made with this property would support reasoning, ceteris paribus, that the genesis period of the find context is likely to form part of the related instance of E4 Period, or at least overlap with it. “Sufficient number” means that the density of objects of this kind in the find context is compatible with the general density that this kind of object had during the associated period in contexts of a comparable nature and deposition history.

- The 1938 archaeological excavation, carried out by Pietro Romanelli (A9), investigated the archaeological site of the ancient Etruscan city of Tarquinia (E27). (Romanelli, 1940)

In First Order Logic of the inverse property:
- AP3(x,y) ⇒ A9(x)
- AP3(x,y) ⇒ E27(y)
- AP3(x,y) ⇒ O8(x,y)

- The death of the trees caused by beetle infestation in 1995 (S18), altered the Brazilian forest (E18) (Paine, 2008). 
- The application of tension (S18) altered the humidified parchment of the Lanhydrock Pedigree (E18) (Pickwoad, 2010).

In First Order Logic:
- O18(x,y) ⇒ S18(x)
- O18(x,y) ⇒ E18(y)

- The determination of the position of the Titanic by officer Joseph G. Boxhall after the initial distress signal was sent (S23) has validity time-span the time of the collision (E52). [Boxhall was convinced of the correctness of his position determination until his death.] (Halpern 2011, Boxhall, 1962)
- The determination of the position of the Titanic by Robert Ballard's team after the Titanic ship-wreck was found (S23) has validity time-span the time of the position determination (E52).

Examples of the inverse property:
- The determination of the position of the Titanic for the initial distress call after hitting an iceberg (S23) has validity time-span the time of the collision (E52). [This is a plausible guess based on Boxhall’s account; the collision was on 14 April 1912 23:40 ship’s time.] (Halpern, 2011, Boxhall, 1962)
- The determination of the position of the Titanic by officer Joseph G. Boxhall after the initial distress signal was sent (S23) has validity time-span the time of the collision (E52). [Boxhall was convinced of the correctness of his position determination until his death.] (Halpern 2011, Boxhall, 1962)
- The determination of the position of the Titanic by Robert Ballard's team after the Titanic ship-wreck was found (S23) has validity time-span the time of the position determination (E52). [This time period falls within the 1(st) of September 1985 00:48, i.e. the first encounter of a piece of Titanic debris and 1987] (Ballard et al., 1987)

Encoding the observed property by type, observed entity and value (properties O9, O10, O16) is a method to circumscribe the reification of the observed property by the respective instance of S4 Observation.
In an RDFS encoding, this circumscription can be transformed into an explicit representation of the observed property in terms of a formal ontology either by use of a reification construct or by the use of a Named Graph containing the observed property. The latter representation allows for more formal reasoning with the model, the former is more flexible about the kinds of observations.

- The seismic hazard analysis and recording by EPPO in 1990 (S4), in the area of Attiki observed property type share wave velocity (S9) and recorded it (Lucchese et al., 2013; Kritikos et al., 2013; InGeoCloudS, 2012; InGeoCloudS, 2013)

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E53 Place with an instance of E94 Space Primitive that defines it. Syntactic variants or use of different scripts may result in multiple instances of E94 Space Primitive defining exactly the same place. Transformations between different reference systems always result in new definitions of places approximating each other and not in alternative definitions.

Examples:
- The centroid from https://sws.geonames.org/735927 (E53) place is defined by 40°31'17.9\"N 21°15'48.3\"E (E94). [A single point for approximating the centre of the city of Kastoria, Greece]

- Martin’s centroid for Kastoria (E53) place is defined by 40°31'01.5\"N 21°15'48\"E (E94). [A point in the lake of Kastoria in the centre of the area covered by the city]

Scope note:
This property describes the maximum spatial extent within which an instance of E53 Place falls. Since instances of E53 Places may not have precisely known spatial extents, the CIDOC CRM supports statements about maximum spatial extents of instances of E53 Place. This property allows an instance of E53 Place’s maximum spatial extent (i.e., its outer boundary) to be assigned an instance of E94 Space Primitive value. 
This property is a shortcut of the fully developed path from E53 Place, P89 falls within, E53 Place, P168 place is defined by to E94 Space Primitive through a declarative Place that is not explicitly documented, to a Space Primitive: declarative places are defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013).

Scope note:
This property describes a minimum spatial extent which is contained within an instance of E53 Place. Since instances of E53 Place may not have precisely known spatial extents, the CIDOC CRM supports statements about minimum spatial extents of instances of E53 Place. This property allows an instance of E53 Place’s minimum spatial extent (i.e., its inner boundary or a point being within a Place) to be assigned an instance of E94 Space Primitive value. 
This property is a shortcut of the fully developed path from E53 Place, P89i contains, E53 Place, P168 place is defined by to E94 Space Primitive.

Examples:
- The spatial extent of the Acropolis of Athens (E53) contains POINT (37.971431 23.725947) (E94).

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E90 Symbolic Object with a complete, identifying representation of its content in the form of an instance of E62 String. 
This property only applies to instances of E90 Symbolic Object that can be represented completely in this form. The representation may be more specific than the symbolic level defining the identity condition of the represented. This depends on the type of the symbolic object represented. For instance, if a name has type “Modern Greek character sequence”, it may be represented in a loss-free Latin transcription, meaning however the sequence of Greek letters. 
As another example, if the represented object has type “English words sequence”, American English or British English spelling variants may be chosen to represent the English word “colour” without defining a different symbolic object. If a name has type “European traditional name”, no particular string may define its content.

Examples:
- The materials description of the painting (E33) has symbolic content “Oil, French Watercolors on Paper, Graphite and Ink on Canvas, with an Oak frame.” (E62).
- The title of Einstein’s 1915 text (E35) has symbolic content “Relativity, the Special and the General Theory” (E62). (Einstein, 2001)
- The story of Little Red Riding Hood (E33) has symbolic content “Once upon a time there lived in a certain village.” (E62). (Lang, 1965)
- The inscription on Rijksmuseum object SK-A-1601 (E34) has symbolic content “B” (E62). [reference: https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-1601/catalogue-entry (accessed 10(th) April 2021)]

Scope note:
This property is a container for all informal descriptions about an object that have not been expressed in terms of CIDOC CRM constructs. 
In particular, it captures the characterisation of the item itself, its internal structures, appearance, etc.
Like property P2 has type (is type of), this property is a consequence of the restricted focus of the CIDOC CRM. The aim is not to capture, in a structured form, everything that can be said about an item; indeed, the CIDOC CRM formalism is not regarded as sufficient to express everything that can be said. Good practice requires use of distinct note fields for different aspects of a characterisation. The P3.1 has type property of P3 has note allows differentiation of specific notes, e.g. “construction”, “decoration”, etc. 
An item may have many notes, but a note is attached to a specific item.

Examples:
- Coffee mug – OXCMS:1983.1.1 (E19) has note “chipped at edge of handle” (E62) has type Condition (E55). (fictitious)

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of E52 Time-Span with an instance of E61 Time Primitive specifying a minimum period of time covered by it. Since Time-Spans may not have precisely known temporal extents, the CIDOC CRM supports statements about the minimum and maximum temporal extents of Time-Spans. This property allows a Time-Span’s minimum temporal extent (i.e., its inner boundary) to be assigned an E61 Time Primitive value. Time Primitives are treated by the CIDOC CRM as application or system specific date intervals, and are not further analysed. If different sources of evidence justify different minimum extents without contradicting each other, the smallest interval including all these extents will be the best estimate. This should be taken into account for information integration.

Examples:
- The time-span of the development of the CIDOC CRM (E52) ongoing throughout “1996-2003” (E61). (Doerr, 2003)
- The Time-Span of the Thirty Years War (E52) ongoing throughout “23(rd) May 1618 AD until 24(th) October 1648 AD” (E61). (Bonney, 2014)
- The time-span of the First Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt (7(th) to 10(th) dynasty) (E52) ongoing throughout “2181 BC – 2160 BC” (E61). (Reid, 1993) [This is the minimal common agreement of two conflicting dates: James Henry Breasted dates the First Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt (7(th) to 10(th) dynasty) from 2475BC to 2160BC in his Ancient Records (first published in 1906), volume 1, sections 58–75 (Breasted, 1906). Ian Shaw dates it from 2181BC to 2125BC in his Oxford History of Ancient Egypt (published in 2000), pp. 479–483 (Shaw, 2000).]

Scope note:
This property describes the maximum period of time within which an E52 Time-Span falls. Since Time-Spans may not have precisely known temporal extents, the CIDOC CRM supports statements about the minimum and maximum temporal extents of Time-Spans. This property allows a Time-Span’s maximum temporal extent (i.e. its outer boundary) to be assigned an E61 Time Primitive value. Time Primitives are treated by the CIDOC CRM as application or system specific date intervals, and are not further analysed. If different sources of evidence justify different maximum extents without contradicting each other, the resulting intersection of all these extents will be the best estimate. This should be taken into account for information integration.

Examples:
- The time-span of the development of the CIDOC CRM (E52) at some time within “1992-infinity” (E61). (Doerr, 2003)
- The Time-Span of the Battle in the Teutoburg Forest (E52) at some time within “September 9 CE” (E61). (Andrews & Kesteven, 1977)
- The time-Span of the death of Tut Ankh Amun (E52) at some time within “December 1324 BC to February 1323 BC” (E61). (Murdoch, 2003)
- The time-span of the First Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt (7(th) to 10(th) dynasty) (E52) at some time within “2475BC - 2125BC” (E61). (Reid, 1993)

In First Order Logic:
- P82(x,y) ⇒ E52(x) 
- P82(x,y) ⇒ E61(y)

Scope note:
This property associates an instance of S23 Position Determination with the instance of E94 Space Primitive which is the result of that determination. The instance of E94 Space Primitive approximates the place occupied by the entity whose position is being determined.

Examples:
- The determination of the position of the Titanic for the initial distress call after hitting an iceberg (S23) determined position 41°44′N 50°24′W (E94). [This was quickly determined via ‘dead reckoning’, i.e. based on the distance travelled since the previous known location, extrapolating a previous dead reckoning for 14 April 1912 20:00] (Halpern, 2011, Boxhall, 1962)
- The determination of the position of the Titanic by officer Joseph G. Boxhall after the initial distress signal was sent (S23) determined position 41°46′N 50°14′W (E94). [This was again determined via dead reckoning but extrapolating Boxhall's own determination shortly after 20:00, and revised the original position.] (Halpern, 2011, Boxhall, 1962)
- The calculation of the position of the Titanic by Robert Ballard's team after the Titanic ship-wreck was found (S23) determined position 41°43′32′′N 49°56′49′′W (E94). [This was the position of the centre of the ‘boiler field’, part of the Titanic debris] (Ballard et al., 1987)
- Samuel Halpern’s 2007 determination of the position of the Titanic at the time of the collision (S23) determined position 41°45.5′N 49°55′W (E94). [This was based on the position of the boiler field and the ocean drift at the time.] (Halpern, 2007)

- O30(x,y) ⇒ S23(x)
- O30(x,y) ⇒ E94(y)

This class comprises associations between an instance of any class, and signs or arrangements of signs that are used to refer to and identify that instance.
Signs include alphanumeric characters, ideograms, notations such as chemical structure symbols, sound symbols, etc. The scripts or type sets for the symbols used to compose an instance of F12 Nomen have to be sufficiently specified. Spelling variants are regarded as different nomens, whereas the use of different fonts (visual representation variants) or different digital encodings do not change the identity.
An arbitrary combination of signs or symbols cannot be regarded as an appellation or designation until it is associated with something in some context. In that sense, the F12 Nomen class can be understood as the reification of a relationship between an instance of E1 CRM Entity and an instance of E41 Appellation. Two instances of F12 Nomen can happen to be associated with equivalent strings and yet remain distinct, as long as they refer to distinct instances of E1 CRM Entity. Furthermore, two instances of F12 Nomen referring to the same instance of E1 CRM Entity may be associated with equivalent strings, and remain distinct as long as they are associated with distinct properties of the F12 Nomen class (for example, having the same spelling in different languages, or being defined in different controlled vocabularies).
An instance of F12 Nomen associates a combination of signs with an instance of E1 CRM Entity on the basis of a cultural or linguistic convention: by associating a string with anything, the instance of F12 Nomen establishes a meaning that is not inherent in the instance of E62 String that is associated with it. Depending on context of use, nomens associated with equivalent strings can be associated with instances of different things in the real world even within the same language (polysemy and homonymy). Conversely, the same thing can be referred to through any number of nomens (synonymy). In the controlled environment of a bibliographic information system, though, homonymy is avoided.
Instances of F12 Nomen are assigned and associated with instances of E1 CRM Entity either formally (such as by bibliographic agencies) or informally through common usage. When they are assigned formally, the construction of the instances of E62 String that represent them may follow predetermined rules.

This class comprises works that are, or have been, planned to result in sequences of Expressions or Manifestations with common features. Whereas a work can acquire new members during the time it evolves, Expressions and Manifestations are identified with a certain state achieved at a particular point in time. Therefore there is in general no single Expression or Manifestation representing a complete serial work, unless the serial work has ended.
Serial Works may or may not have a plan for an overall expression.
The retrospective reprinting of all issues of a Serial Work at once, in the form of a monograph, is regarded to be another member of the F1 Work, which contains the Serial Work and the Work realised in the monograph. This does not make the monograph part of the Serial Work.

This class comprises distinct intellectual ideas conveyed in artistic and intellectual creations, such a poems, stories or musical compositions.
A Work is the outcome of an intellectual process of one or more persons. Inherent to the notion of work is the existence of recognisable realizations of the work in the form of one or more expressions. Works are often regarded as finished and discrete e.g. when declared as such by the creator of the work or based on the elaboration or logical coherence of its content. However, works may be recognized as existing but unfinished e.g. if the creators deliberately or accidentally never explicitly finished a particular Expression but have left behind partial expressions.
In the absence of explicit information about the initial conception, which is rarely available, the first expression created constitutes witness of the beginning of existence of a Work.
A Work can evolve over time, such as through revised editions. A Work may be elaborated by one or more Actors simultaneously, in parallel, or over time. Additional expressions of a Work can continue to be created over time.
The boundaries of a Work have nothing to do with the value of the intellectual achievement but only with the dominance of a concept.
The main purpose of this class is to enable bringing together intellectually equivalent Expressions in order to display to a user all available alternatives of the same intellectual or artistic content.

This class comprises activities by which instances of F1 Work come into existence. An instance of F27 Work Creation can serve to document the period a work was coming into existence and the circumstances of it, when these are known.
An instance of F27 Work Creation marks the initial creation of an instance of F1 Work through expressions or other externalisations that are sufficiently elaborated so that the characteristic conceptual identity of the work could be recognized as existing.
In many cases this will coincide with the first known complete externalisation of an expression of the work. In other cases, the initial creation of an instance of F1 Work may be inferred from multiple, or later, expressions or other forms of evidence. For instance, commissioning of a work may explicitly be agreed on after the presentation of an already complete and detailed elaboration of the work that was not made public. Performances may be prior to written expressions, as in the case of Shakespeare’s works.
The work, as an intellectual construction, may evolve from its initial creation onwards, until the last known expression of it.
An instance of E39 Actor with which a work is associated through the chain of properties F1 Work. R16i was created by: F27 Work Creation. P14 carried out by (performed): E39 Actor corresponds to the notion of the “creator” of the work.
In the situation where an expression of one instance of F1 Work serves as source material for the creation of the first expression of a new instance of F1 Work, the direct relationship between the works is indicated using the property R2 is derivative of (has derivative) between the two instances of F1 Work. The link to the specific source expression is indicated with the property P16 used specific object (was used for) using the path: F1 Work(1). R3 is realised in: F2 Expression(1). P16i was used for: F27 Work Creation. R16 created: F1 Work(2).

This class comprises activities that result in instances of F2 Expression coming into existence. An instance of F2 Expression is considered to be created when it is captured on a carrier other than the creator’s brain.
Although F2 Expression is an abstract entity, a conceptual object, the creation of an expression inevitably also affects the physical world: when you scribble the first draft of a poem on a sheet of paper, you produce an instance of F3 Manifestation and an instance of F5 Item. F28 Expression Creation is a subclass of E12 Production because the recording of the expression causes a physical modification of the E18 Physical Thing that serves as the carrier. The creation of an instance of F2 Expression coincides with the creation of the first instance of F3 Manifestation that R4 embodies (is embodied in) this instance of F2 Expression.
The P2 has type (is type of) property can be used to specify the type of the instance of F28 Expression Creation (i.e., activities such as translating, revising, or arranging music are types of creation process). The type of the process is distinct from the type of result even though the typology frequently used for instances of the resulting F2 Expressions may imply the category of the instance of the F28 Expression Creation.
An instance of F28 Expression Creation may use as source material one or more specific instances of F2 Expression. When the source expression is documented this is also expressed by the property R76 is derivative of (has derivative).

This class comprises the intellectual or artistic realisations of Works in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as texts, poems, jokes, musical or choreographic notations, movement pattern, sound pattern, images, multimedia objects, or any combination of such forms. The substance of F2 Expression is signs.
An Expression is the outcome of the intellectual or creative process of realizing a Work. Subsequent expressions conveying the same work may be created over time.
Expressions do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. As far as bibliographic practice is concerned, only instances of F2 Expression that are externalised on physical carriers other than both the creator’s brain and an auditor’s brain are taken into account.
The form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression. Differences in form imply different Expressions (e.g., from text to spoken word, a transcript of a recording). Similarly, differences in language or means of performance imply different Expressions (e.g., translations or arrangements for different instruments). Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the result is considered to be a new F2 Expression. While theoretically any change in signs will result in a new Expression, conventionally the context and use will determine the rules for distinguishing among expressions.
An instance of F2 Expression which includes spoken or written text may be multiply instantiated as an instance of E33 Linguistic Object. This allows for the association of the E56 Language of the text with the instance of F2 Expression by using the property P72 has language (is language of).

This class comprises activities where an instance of F1 Work is presented or communicated directly or indirectly to an audience, such as a theatrical play, a musical work or a choreographic work.
Performances can be identified at various levels of granularity, but an instance of F31 Performance is always associated with a single identified instance of F1 Work. An instance of F31 Performance may consist of other instances of F31 Performance as parts, such as a piano concerto that has multiple movements. In addition, a complete run of equivalent performances of the same work can also be seen as an instance of F31 Performance, with the individual performances as parts.
Activities that include performing multiple individual works, e.g., that are put together as a program for a show or concert, but where the activity as a whole is not associated with an instance of F1 Work, should be represented as instances of E7 Activity consisting of individual instances of F31 Performances as parts (the property P9 consists of (forms part of) expresses the relationship).
Instances of F31 Performance may be created according to specific staging directions, be based on specific known instances of F2 Expression (such as translations), or be influenced by or include elements that relate to different works other than the single work the performance is dominated by. This can be documented using the properties P16 used specific object (was used for) or P15 was influenced by (influenced).

Examples:
- the performance of a Yiddish translation of the textual work entitled ‘King Lear’, as directed by Sergei Radlov, in Moscow, at the Moscow State Jewish Theatre, on February 10, 1935
- the performance of the ballet entitled ‘Rite of spring’, as choreographed by Pina Bausch, in Avignon, at the Popes’ Palace, on July 7, 1995
- the performance of the operatic work entitled ‘Dido and Aeneas’, as directed by Edward Gordon Craig and conducted by Martin Shaw, in London, Hampstead Conservatoire, on May 17, 18, and 19, 1900
- the performance of Verdi’s ‘La Traviata’ at the Salzburg Festival in 2005, that was staged by Willy Decker, directed by Brian Large and featuring Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón
- the performance of Michel Fokine’s choreography and libretto (choreographic work) for Stravinsky’s ‘The Firebird’ by the Mariinsky Orchestra and Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, June 2008

This class comprises products rendering one or more Expressions. A Manifestation is defined by both the overall content and the form of its presentation. The substance of F3 Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.
An F3 Manifestation is the outcome of a publication process where one or more F2 Expressions are prepared for public dissemination, but it may also be a unique form created directly on some material carrier without the intent of being formally published.
An instance of F3 Manifestation typically incorporates one or more instances of F2 Expression representing a distinct logical content and all additional input by a publisher such as text layout and cover design. Additionally an F3 Manifestation can be identified by the physical features for the medium of distribution, if applicable. For example, publications in the form of hard-cover and paperback editions would be two distinct instances of F3 Manifestation, even though authorial and editorial content are otherwise identical in both publications.
In the case of industrial products such as printed books or music CDs, but also digital material, an instance of F3 Manifestation can be regarded as the prototype for all copies of it. In these cases, an instance of F3 Manifestation specifies all of the features or traits that instances of F5 Item display in order to be copies of a particular publication. In the case of industrial products, instances of F3 Manifestation are also instances of E99 Product Type, normally nowadays identified by characteristic identifiers such as ISBN numbers.

This class comprises recognizable groups or organizations of persons that have the potential of acting as a unit to produce some intentional result of bibliographic interest for which they can be collectively considered responsible.
A group of people becomes an instance of F55 Collective Agent when it identifies itself by a name that identifies it within an appropriate context and exhibits sufficient organizational characteristics to permit it to perform actions that reflect agency. Groups that are constituted as meetings, conferences, congresses, expeditions, festivals, fairs, etc. are examples of F55 Collective Agent as long as they self-identify by a specific name, rather than being referred to by a generic description of the gathering, and can act as a unit (such as by publishing their proceedings, or approving a report). These collective actions may be performed by representatives selected by the whole, rather than by all individual members acting together.
Collective Agents may be members of other Collective Agents, although directly or indirectly all Collective Agents are composed of persons. The membership of many types of Collective Agents will continue to evolve over time. A Collective Agent may continue to exist even if it has no members for a time (for example, a committee whose members all resign prior to the expiration of their terms but then a new complement of members is appointed).
Instances of F55 Collective Agent include instances of its subclass F11 Corporate Body: commercial or corporate entities and other legally registered bodies, as well as organizations and associations, musical, artistic or performing groups, governments, and any of their sub-units.
Married couples and other concepts of family (instances of F39 Family) are instances of a subclass of F55 Collective Agent.
In the wider sense, this class also comprises holders of official positions viewed collectively, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country. In such cases, it is possible that the instance of F55 Collective Agent has only ever had a single member.
A group of persons known by/using a joint pseudonym (i.e., a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually adopted as a persona by two or more people acting together) is a case of F55 Collective Agent.

Examples:
- International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (F11)
- 81st World Library and Information Conference (F11)
- Bibliothèque nationale de France (F11)
- Exxon-Mobil (F11)
- The Beatles (F11)
- the brothers Grimm (F39)
- the President of the Swiss Confederation
- Nicolas Bourbaki [collective pseudonym of a group of 20(th) century French mathematicians also known as the ‘Association des collaborateurs de Nicolas Bourbaki’]
- Ellery Queen [joint pseudonym for detective fiction of cousins Frederic Dannay and Manfred Bennington Less who also wrote separately]

This class comprises physical objects (printed books, scores, CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMS, etc.) that were produced by (P186i) an industrial process involving a given instance of F3 Manifestation. As a result, all the instances of F5 Item associated with a given instance of F3 Manifestation are expected to carry the content defined in that instance of F3 Manifestation, although some or even all of them may happen to carry a content that significantly differs from it, due to either an accident in the course of industrial production, or subsequent physical modification or degradation.
An instance of F5 Item that consists of a physical object or set of objects with clear physical boundaries is also an instance of E22 Human-Made Object. An instance of F5 Item that is stored on a part of a larger physical support (such as an electronic file among others on a disc) can also be considered to be an instance of E25 Human-Made Feature.
The notion of F5 Item is only relevant with regard to the production process, from a bibliographic point of view. The physical units managed by cultural heritage institutions in their holdings are a distinct notion: a unit of holdings certainly can be equal to an instance of F5 Item, but it also can be either “bigger” than one (e.g., when two instances of F5 Item are bound together (in the case of printed books)), or “smaller” than one (e.g., for incomplete holdings, such as when only one CD from a two-CD set is held). From an operational point of view, cultural heritage institutions typically do not manage instances of F5 Item, but physical holdings units, instances of E19 Physical Object, although for libraries in most cases this is not significant because each item corresponds with a single unit. When this is not the case, the linkage between items and the units relevant for collection management can be recorded through the P46 is composed of (forms part of) property between instances of F5 Item and instances of E19 Physical Object. If needed, an instance of E19 Physical Object can be typed as a unit through the P2 has type (is type of) property.

This class comprises transfers of the physical custody or the legal responsibility for the physical custody of objects. The recording of the donor or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E10 Transfer of Custody there is either no donor or no recipient. 
Depending on the circumstances, it may describe: 
1. the beginning of custody (there is no previous custodian)
2. the end of custody (there is no subsequent custodian)
3. the transfer of custody (transfer from one custodian to the next)
4. the receipt of custody from an unknown source (the previous custodian is unknown)
5. the declared loss of an object (the current or subsequent custodian is unknown)
In the event that only a single kind of transfer of custody occurs, either the legal responsibility for the custody or the actual physical possession of the object but not both, this difference should be expressed using the property 
P2 has type (is type of).
The sense of physical possession requires that the object of custody be in the hands of the keeper at least with a part representative for the whole. The way, in which a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps a part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept instance of E18 Physical Thing.
The interpretation of the museum notion of \"accession\" differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these. 
Theft is a specific case of illegal transfer of custody.

Examples:
- the delivery of the paintings by Secure Deliveries Inc. to the National Gallery
- the return of Picasso’s “Guernica” to Madrid’s Prado in 1981 (Chipp, 1988)
- the transfer of custody of the work described as “Von der Velden ein Ufer an der See” from Johann Matthäus von Merian to the Auction House Heldevier (Jacob) for the purpose of sale, ca. 1716
- the transfer of custody of the painting ‘Mrs. Fitzherbert’ to the art dealer Knoedler from Parke-Bernet Galleries (New York, NY, USA) ca. March 1941

This class comprises instances of E7 Activity that are undertaken to create, alter or change instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.
This class includes the production of an item from raw materials and other so far undocumented objects. It also includes the conservation treatment of an object.
Since the distinction between modification and production is not always clear, modification is regarded as the more generally applicable concept. This implies that some items may be consumed or destroyed in an instance of E11 Modification, and that others may be produced as a result of it. An event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities.
An activity undertaken on an object which was designed to alter it, but which, in fact, it did not in any seemingly significant way (such as the application of a solvent during conservation which failed to dissolve any part of the object), is still considered as an instance of E11 Modification. Typically, any such activity will leave at least forensic traces of evidence on the object.
If the instance of E29 Design or Procedure utilized for the modification prescribes the use of specific materials, they should be documented using property P68 foresees use of (use foreseen by): E57 Material of E29 Design or Procedure, rather than via P126 employed (was employed in): E57 Material.

Examples:
- the construction of the SS Great Britain (E12) (Gregor, 1971)
- the impregnation of the Vasa warship in Stockholm for preservation after 1956 (Håfors, 2010)
- the transformation of the Enola Gay into a museum exhibit by the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC between 1993 and 1995 (E12, E81) (Yakel, 2000)

In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one. 
This entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event. 
An event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.

Examples:
- the construction of the SS Great Britain (Gregor, 1971)
- the first casting of the Little Mermaid from the harbour of Copenhagen (Dewey, 2003)
- Rembrandt’s creating of the seventh state of his etching “Woman sitting half dressed beside a stove”, 1658, identified by Bartsch Number 197 (E12, E65, E81) (Hind, 1923)

This class comprises the actions of making assertions about one property of an object or any single relation between two items or concepts. The type of the property asserted to hold between two items or concepts can be described by the property P177 assigned property of type (is type of property assigned): E55 Type. 
For example, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain scientific/scholarly procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on whether this information should be accessible by structured queries.
This class allows for the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. Note that all instances of properties described in a knowledge base are the opinion of someone. Per default, they are the opinion of the team maintaining the knowledge base. This fact must not individually be registered for all instances of properties provided by the maintaining team, because it would result in an endless recursion of whose opinion was the description of an opinion. Therefore, the use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment marks the fact that the maintaining team is in general neutral to the validity of the respective assertion, but registers someone else’s opinion and how it came about.
All properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly relating the respective pair of items or concepts. Multiple use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment may possibly lead to a collection of contradictory values.

Examples:
- the examination of MS Sinai Greek 418 by Nicholas Pickwoad in November 2003 (Honey & Pickwoad, 2010)
- the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr’s silver cup in February 1997 (fictitious)

This class comprises activities that result in the allocation of an identifier to an instance of E1 CRM Entity. An instance of E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.
Examples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when, and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.
The fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as “preferred identifier assignment”, to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment through the P2 has type (is type of) property.

Examples:
- replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17(th) century lamentation cloth at the Museum Benaki, Athens
- assigning the author and uniform title heading “Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832. Faust. 1. Theil.” to a work 
- on 1(st) June 2001, assigning the personal name heading “Guillaume, de Machaut, ca. 1300-1377” to Guillaume de Machaut (Kelly, 2014)

This class comprises actions measuring physical properties and other values that can be determined by a systematic, objective procedure of direct observation of particular states of physical reality. 
An instance of E16 Measurement may use simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Methods and devices employed should be associated with instances of E16 Measurement by properties such as P33 used specific technique: E29 Design or Procedure, P125 used object of type: E55 Type, P16 used specific object (was used for): E70 Thing, whereas basic techniques such as \"carbon-14 dating\" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of): E55 Type. Details of methods and devices reused or reusable in other instances of E16 Measurement should be documented for these entities rather than the measurements themselves, whereas details of particular execution may be documented by free text or by instantiating adequate sub-activities, if the detail may be of interest for an overarching query.
Regardless whether a measurement is made by an instrument or by human senses, it represents the initial transition from physical reality to information without any other documented information object in between within the reasoning chain that would represent the result of the interaction of the observer or device with reality. Therefore, determining properties of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is regarded as an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment, which may be inferred from observing and measuring representative carriers. In the case that the carrier can be named, the property P16 used specific object (was used for) should be used to indicate the instance(s) of E18 Physical Thing that was used as the empirical basis for the attribute assignment. For instance, inferring properties of depicted items using image material, such as satellite images, is not regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement, but as a subsequent instance of E13 Attribute Assignment. Rather, only the production of the images, understood as arrays of radiation intensities, is regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement. The same reasoning holds for other sensor data.

Examples:
- measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (fictitious)
- the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 [The carbon 14 dating of an approximately 400.000 year old complete Old Palaeolithic wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany, in 1995.] (Kouwenhoven, 1997)

This class comprises all persistent physical items with a relatively stable form, human-made or natural.
Depending on the existence of natural boundaries of such things, the CIDOC CRM distinguishes the instances of E19 Physical Object from instances of E26 Physical Feature, such as holes, rivers, pieces of land, etc. Most instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy), whereas features are integral to the surrounding matter.
An instance of E18 Physical Thing occupies not only a particular geometric space at any instant of its existence, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. For the purpose of more detailed descriptions of the presence of an instance of E18 Physical Thing in space and time it can be associated with its specific instance of E92 Spacetime Volume by the property P196 defines (is defined by). 
The CIDOC CRM is generally not concerned with amounts of matter in fluid or gaseous states, as long as they are not confined in an identifiable way for an identifiable minimal time-span.

- the Cullinan Diamond (E19) (Scarratt and Shor, 2006)

This class comprises items of a material nature that are units for documentation and have physical boundaries that separate them completely in an objective way from other objects. 
The class also includes all aggregates of objects made for functional purposes of whatever kind, independent of physical coherence, such as a set of chessmen. Typically, instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy).
In some contexts, such objects, except for aggregates, are also called “bona fide objects”, i.e. naturally defined objects (Smith & Varzi, 2000). 
The decision as to what is documented as a complete item, rather than by its parts or components, may be purely administrative or may be a result of the order in which the item was acquired.

Examples:
- Aphrodite of Milos (E22) (Kousser, 2005)
- the Cullinan Diamond (Scarratt and Shor, 2006)
- Apollo 13 at the time of launch (E22) (Lovell and Kluger, 1994)

This class comprises real persons who live or are assumed to have lived. 
Legendary figures that may have existed, such as Ulysses and King Arthur, fall into this class if the documentation refers to them as historical figures. In cases where doubt exists as to whether several persons are in fact identical, multiple instances can be created and linked to indicate their relationship. The CIDOC CRM does not propose a specific form to support reasoning about possible identity.
In a bibliographic context, a name presented following the conventions usually employed for personal names will be assumed to correspond to an actual real person (an instance of E21 Person), unless evidence is available to indicate that this is not the case. The fact that a persona may erroneously be classified as an instance of E21 Person does not imply that the concept comprises personae.

This class comprises all persistent physical items of any size that are purposely created by human activity. This class comprises, besides others, human-made objects, such as a sword, and human-made features, such as rock art. For example, a “cup and ring” carving on bedrock is regarded as instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.
Instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may be the result of modifying pre-existing physical things, preserving larger parts or most of the original matter and structure, which poses the question if they are new or even human-made, the respective interventions of production made on such original material should be obvious and sufficient to regard that the product has a new, distinct identity and intended function and is human-made. Substantial continuity of the previous matter and structure in the new product can be documented by describing the production process also as an instance of E81 Transformation.
Whereas interventions of conservation and repair are not regarded to produce a new instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing, the results of preparation of natural history specimens that substantially change their natural or original state should be regarded as instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Things, including the uncovering of petrified biological features from a solid piece of stone. On the other side, scribbling a museum number on a natural object should not be regarded to make it human-made. This notwithstanding, parts, sections, segments, or features of an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may continue to be non-human-made and preserved during the production process, for example natural pearls used as a part of an eardrop.

Examples:
- the Forth Railway Bridge (Shipway, Bouch, Baker and Fowler, 1990).
- the Channel Tunnel (E25) (Holliday, Marcou and Vickerman, 1991)
- the Palace of Knossos (Evans, 1921)
- the Colosseum in Rome, Italy (Hopkins and Beard, 2011)
- the Historical Collection of the Museum Benaki in Athens (E78) (Georgoula, 2005)
- the Rosetta Stone (E22)

This class comprises identifiable features that are physically attached in an integral way to particular physical objects. 
Instances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not. 
Instances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature. 
This definition coincides with the definition of “fiat objects”, with the exception of aggregates of “bona fide objects” (Smith & Varzi, 2000).

Examples:
- the cave of Dirou, Mani, Greece (Psimenos. 2005)
- the temple in Abu Simbel before its removal, which was carved out of solid rock (E25) (Hawass, 2000)
- Albrecht Duerer's signature on his painting of Charles the Great (E25) (Strauss, 1974)
- the damage to the nose of the Great Sphinx in Giza (Temple, 2009)
- Michael Jackson’s nose prior to plastic surgery

This class comprises non-material products of our minds and other human produced data that have become objects of a discourse about their identity, circumstances of creation, or historical implication. The production of such information might have been supported by the use of technical devices such as cameras or computers.
Characteristically, instances of this class are created, invented or thought by someone, and then may be documented or communicated between persons. Instances of E28 Conceptual Object have the ability to exist on more than one particular carrier at the same time, such as paper, electronic signals, marks, audio media, paintings, photos, human memories, etc.
They cannot be destroyed. They exist as long as they can be found on at least one carrier or in at least one human memory. Their existence ends when the last carrier and the last memory are lost.

Examples:
- Beethoven’s “Ode an die Freude” (Ode to Joy) (E73) (Kershaw, 1999)
- the definition of “ontology” in the Oxford English Dictionary (E73) (Oxford University Press, 1989)
- the knowledge about the victory at Marathon carried by the famous runner (E89) (Lagos & Karyanos, 2020)
- [Explanation note: The following examples illustrate the distinction between a propositional object, its names and its encoded forms. The Maxwell equations (Ball, 1962) are a good example, because they belong to the fundamental laws of physics and their mathematical content yields identical, unambiguous results regardless formulation and encoding.]

Designs or procedures can be seen as one of the following:
1. A schema for the activities it describes
2. A schema of the products that result from their application
3. An independent intellectual product that may have never been applied, such as Leonardo da Vinci’s famous plans for flying machines
Because designs or procedures may never be applied or only partially executed, the CIDOC CRM models a loose relationship between the plan and the respective product.

- the musical notation for Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” (Kershaw, 1999)
- the architectural drawings for the Kölner Dom (Cologne Cathedral) in Cologne, Germany (Wolff, 1999)

This class comprises all phenomena, such as the instances of E4 Periods and E5 Events, which happen over a limited extent in time. This extent in time must be contiguous, i.e., without gaps. In case the defining kinds of phenomena for an instance of E2 Temporal Entity cease to happen, and occur later again at another time, we regard that the former instance of E2 Temporal Entity has ended and a new instance has come into existence. In more intuitive terms, the same event cannot happen twice.
In some contexts, such phenomena are also called perdurants. This class is disjoint from E77 Persistent Item and is an abstract class that typically has no direct instances. E2 Temporal Entity is specialized into E4 Period, which applies to a particular geographic area (defined with a greater or lesser degree of precision), and E3 Condition State, which applies to instances of E18 Physical Thing.

Examples:
- Bronze Age (E4) (Childe, 1963)
- the earthquake in Lisbon 1755 (E5) (Chester, 2001)
- the Peterhof Palace near Saint Petersburg being in ruins from 1944 to 1946 (E3) (Maddox, 2015)

This class comprises identifiable expressions in natural language or languages. 
Instances of E33 Linguistic Object can be expressed in many ways: e.g. as written texts, recorded speech, or sign language. However, the CIDOC CRM treats instances of E33 Linguistic Object independently from the medium or method by which they are expressed. Expressions in formal languages, such as computer code or mathematical formulae, are not treated as instances of E33 Linguistic Object by the CIDOC CRM. These should be modelled as instances of E73 Information Object.
In general, an instance of E33 Linguistic Object may also contain non-linguistic information, often of artistic or aesthetic value. Only in cases in which the content of an instance of E33 Linguistic Object can completely be expressed by a series of binary-encoded symbols, its content may be documented within a respective knowledge base by the property P190 has symbolic content: E62 String. Otherwise, it should be understood as an identifiable digital resource only available independently from the respective knowledge base. 
In other cases, such as pages of an illuminated manuscript or recordings containing speech in a language supported by a writing system, the linguistic part of the content of an instance of E33 Linguistic Object may be documented within a respective knowledge base in a note by P3 has note: E62 String. Otherwise, it may be described using the property P165 incorporates (is incorporated in): E73 Information Object as a different object with its own identity.

Examples:
- the text of the Ellesmere Chaucer manuscript (Hilmo, 2019)
- the lyrics of the song “Blue Suede Shoes” (Cooper, 2008)
- the text of the “Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll (Carroll, 1981)
- the text of “Doktoro Jekyll kaj Sinjoro Hyde” [an Esperanto translation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]. (Stevenson, Morrison and Mann, 1909)
- the free dialog in the local dialect recorded in 1958, Telemark, Norway stored on tape or.7-89.s1 (00.15:46-00:34), The Language Collection at the University Library in Bergen, Norway (verified on 2020)

This class comprises the textual strings that within a cultural context can be clearly identified as titles due to their form. Being a subclass of E41 Appellation, E35 Title can only be used when such a string is actually used as a title of a work, such as a text, an artwork, or a piece of music.
Titles are proper noun phrases or verbal phrases, and should not be confused with generic object names such as “chair”, “painting”, or “book” (the latter are common nouns that stand for instances of E55 Type). Titles may be assigned by the creator of the work itself, or by a social group.
This class also comprises the translations of titles that are used as surrogates for the original titles in different social contexts.

- “The Merchant of Venice” (McCullough, 2005)

This class comprises the intellectual or conceptual aspects of recognisable marks and images.
This class does not intend to describe the idiosyncratic characteristics of an individual physical embodiment of a visual item, but the underlying prototype. For example, a mark such as the ICOM logo is generally considered to be the same logo when used on any number of publications. The size, orientation, and colour may change, but the logo remains uniquely identifiable. The same is true of images that are reproduced many times. This means that visual items are independent of their physical support.
The E36 Visual Item class provides a means of identifying and linking together instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing that carry the same visual symbols, marks, or images, etc. The property P62 depicts (is depicted by) between E24 Physical Human-Made Thing and the depicted subjects (E1 CRM Entity) can be regarded as a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Human-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1 CRM Entity, which in addition captures the optical features of the depiction.

Examples:
- the visual appearance of Monet’s “La Pie” (Bortolatto, 1981)
- the Coca-Cola logo (E34)
- the Chi-Rho (E37)
- the communist red star (E37)
- the surface shape of Auguste Rodin's statue \"Le Penseur\" [There exist more than 20 copies, even of different size. Therefore, this is a good example that it is only the common surface shape, an immaterial visual item, which justifies displaying these copies as works of Auguste Rodin. As usual practice, Rodin himself did not produce the bronze statue, but only the prototype model.]

This class comprises the states of objects characterised by a certain condition over a time-span. 
An instance of this class describes the prevailing physical condition of any material object or feature during a specific instance of E52 Time-Span. In general, the time-span for which a certain condition can be asserted may be shorter than the real time-span, for which this condition held.
The nature of that condition can be described using P2 has type. For example, the instance of E3 Condition State “condition of the SS Great Britain between 22(nd) September 1846 and 27(th) August 1847” can be characterized as an instance “wrecked” of E55 Type.

This class comprises all signs, either meaningful or not, or arrangements of signs following a specific syntax, that are used or can be used to refer to and identify a specific instance of some class within a certain context.
Instances of E41 Appellation do not identify things by their meaning, even if they happen to have one, but by convention, tradition, or agreement. Instances of E41 Appellation are cultural constructs; as such, they have a context, a history, and a use in time and space by some group of users. A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e. other instances of E41 Appellation that are regarded as equivalent, regardless of the thing it denotes.
Different languages may use different appellations for the same thing, such as the names of major cities. Some appellations may be formulated using a valid noun phrase of a particular language. In these cases, the respective instances of E41 Appellation should also be declared as instances of E33 Linguistic Object. Then the language using the appellation can be declared with the property P72 has language: E56 Language.
Instances of E41 Appellation may be used to identify any instance of E1 CRM Entity and sometimes are characteristic for instances of more specific subclasses of E1 CRM Entity, such as for instances of E52 Time-Span (for instance “dates”), E39 Actor, E53 Place or E28 Conceptual Object. Postal addresses and E-mail addresses are characteristic examples of identifiers used by services transporting things between clients.
Even numerically expressed identifiers for extents in space or time are also regarded as instances of E41 Appellation, such as Gregorian dates or spatial coordinates, even though they allow for determining some time or location by a known procedure starting from a reference point and by virtue of that fact play a double role as instances of E59 Primitive Value.
E41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something. Cf. E15 Identifier Assignment.

Examples:
- “Martin”
- “Aquae Sulis Minerva”
- “the Merchant of Venice” (E35) (McCullough, 2005)
- “Spigelia marilandica (L.) L.” [not the species, just the name] (Hershberger, Robacker and Jenkins, 2015)
- “information science” [not the science itself, but the name used to refer to the subject matter in an English-speaking context]
- “安” [Chinese “an”, meaning “peace”]
- “6°5’29”N 45°12’13”W” [example of a spatial coordinate]
- “Black queen’s bishop 4” [chess coordinate, example of an identifier in a conceptual space (E89)]
- “19-MAR-1922” [example of date]
- “+41 22 418 5571” [example of contact point]
- “weasel@paveprime.com” [example of contact point]
- “CH-1211, Genève” [example of place appellation]
- “1-29-3 Otsuka, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 121, Japan” [example of a postal address]
- “the poop deck of H.M.S Victory” [example of a section definition on a human-made object (E22)]

This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.
It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an instance of E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.
Often, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore, E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical birth, an instance of E67 Birth, can be seen as both a single event, i.e. an instance of E5 Event, and as an extended period, i.e. an instance of E4 Period, that consists of multiple physical processes and complementary activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.
E4 Period is a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime Volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CIDOC CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance, it is possible to discuss the physical extent of an instance of E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomenon while an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.
Typical use of this class in cultural heritage documentation is for documenting cultural and artistic periods. There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period in the European sphere of influence lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.
A geopolitical unit as a specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena related to the claim of power, the consequences of belonging to a jurisdictional area and an administrative system that establishes a geopolitical unit. Examples from the modern period are countries or administrative areas of countries such as districts whose actions and structures define activities and phenomena in the area that they intend to govern. The borders of geopolitical units are often defined in contracts or treaties although they may deviate from the actual practice. The spatiotemporal properties of Geopolitical units can be modelled through the properties inherited from E92 Spacetime Volume.
Another specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the actual extent of the set of activities and phenomena as evidenced by their physical traces that define a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.

Examples:
- Jurassic (Hallam, 1975)
- Populated Period of Nineveh
- Imperial Rome under Marcus Aurelius
- European Bronze Age (Harrison, 2004) 
- Italian Renaissance (Macdonald, 1992)
- Thirty Years War (Lee, 1991)
- Sturm und Drang (Berkoff, 2013)
- Cubism (Cox, 2000)
- The Capital of Russia (E4) [the capital of Russia in the sense of an administrative unit moved in historical times from Moscow to St Petersburg and then back to Moscow. This exemplifies an administrative unit changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]
- The settling activity of the community of Helsinki (a.k.a. Helsingfors) (E7) [the original settlement called Helsinki was located in the area of the modern airport. The community moved later to settle on the coast. This exemplifies a continued activity changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]
- Bronze Age (E4) [Bronze Age, in the sense of technological adoption, spread over disjoint areas including islands such as the British Isles without temporal discontinuity]
- Japan, the state (E4) [In 2021, the Japanese state as a political unit comprised in 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia]

This class comprises abstract temporal extents, in the sense of Galilean physics, having a beginning, an end, and a duration. 
Instances of E52 Time-Span have no semantic connotations about phenomena happening within the temporal extent they represent. They do not convey any meaning other than a positioning on the “time-line” of chronology. The actual extent of an instance of E52 Time-Span can be approximated by properties of E52 Time-Span giving inner and outer bounds in the form of dates (instances of E61 Time Primitive). Comparing knowledge about time-spans is fundamental for chronological reasoning.
Some instances of E52 Time-Span may be defined as the actual, in principle observable, temporal extent of instances of E2 Temporal Entity via the property P4 has time-span (is time-span of): E52 Time-Span. They constitute phenomenal time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013). Since our knowledge of history is imperfect and physical phenomena are fuzzy in nature, the extent of phenomenal time-spans can only be described in approximation. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an instance of E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. It may, nevertheless, be associated with other descriptions by which people can infer knowledge about it, such as in relative chronologies.
Some instances of E52 may be defined precisely as representing a declaration of a temporal extent, as, for instance, done in a business contract. They constitute declarative time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013) and can be described via the property E61 Time Primitive P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span. 
When used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it will nevertheless describe them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else is known.

Examples:
- 1961
- From 12-17-1993 to 12-8-1996
- 14h30 to 16h22 4(th) July 1945
- 9.30 am 1.1.1999 to 2.00 pm 1.1.1999
- the time-span of the Ming Dynasty (Chan, 2011)

This class comprises extents in the natural space where people live, in particular on the surface of the Earth, in the pure sense of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter. They may serve describing the physical location of things or phenomena or other areas of interest. Geometrically, instances of E53 Place constitute single contiguous areas or a finite aggregation of disjoint areas in space which are each individually contiguous. They may have fuzzy boundaries.
The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks, but may also be determined by reference to mobile objects. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame.
It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, people are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object, i.e. H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.
Any instance of E18 Physical Thing can serve as a frame of reference for an instance of E53 Place. This may be documented using the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).

Examples:
- the extent of the UK in the year 2003
- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring (fictitious)
- the place referred to in the phrase: “Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone”
- here -> <- [the place between these two arrows in one of the reader's paper copy of this document. Each copy constitutes a different place of this spot.]

This class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured by some calibrated means and can be approximated by values, i.e. points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual space, such as natural or real numbers, RGB values, etc.
An instance of E54 Dimension represents the empirical or theoretically derived quantity, including the precision tolerances resulting from the particular method or calculation. The identity of an instance of E54 Dimension depends on the method of its determination because each method may produce different values even when determining comparable qualities. For instance, the wingspan of a bird alive or dead is a different dimension. Thermoluminescence dating and Rehydroxylation [RHX] dating are different dimensions of temporal distance from now, even if they aim at dating the same object. The method of determination should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). Note that simple terms such as “diameter” or “length” are normally insufficient to unambiguously describe a respective dimension. In contrast, “maximum linear extent” may be sufficient.
The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of instances of E54 Dimension adequate to the precision of the applied method of determination. If the respective quantity belongs to a non-discrete space according to the laws of physics, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that comparability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.
Numerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension, as appropriate.

Examples:
- the weight of the Luxor Obelisk [250 metric tons]
- the vertical height of the statue of David by Michelangelo [5.17 metres]
- the weight of the Great Star of Africa diamond [530.2 carats]
- the calibrated C14 date for the Shroud of Turin [AD1262-1312, 1303-1384]
- the horizontal diameter of the Stonehenge Sarsen Circle [33 metres] (Pryor, 2016)
- the length of the sides of the Great Pyramid at Giza [230.34 metres] (Lehner and Hawass, 2017)
- the duration of the time-span of the Battle of Issos/Issus on 15(th) November 333 B.C.E. [less than 12 hours] (Howard, 2012)
- Christie’s hammer price, in British Pounds, for Vincent van Gogh's \"Still Life: Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers\" in London on 30(th) March 1987 (E97) [24.75 million GBP (British Pounds)]

This class comprises concepts denoted by terms from thesauri and controlled vocabularies used to characterize and classify instances of CIDOC CRM classes. Instances of E55 Type represent concepts, in contrast to instances of E41 Appellation which are used to name instances of CIDOC CRM classes. 
E55 Type provides an interface to domain specific ontologies and thesauri. These can be represented in the CIDOC CRM as subclasses of E55 Type, forming hierarchies of terms, i.e. instances of E55 Type linked via P127 has broader term (has narrower term): E55 Type. Such hierarchies may be extended with additional properties.

Examples:
- weight, length, depth [types for instances of E54 Dimension]
- portrait, sketch, animation [types for instances of E36 Visual Item]
- French, English, German [types for instances of E56 Language]
- excellent, good, poor [types for instances of E3 Condition State]
- Ford Model T, chop stick [types for instances of E22 Human-Made Object]
- cave, doline, scratch [types for instances of E26 Physical Feature]
- poem, short story [types for instances of E33 Linguistic Object]
- wedding, earthquake, skirmish [types for instances of E5 Event]

Discrete pieces of raw-materials kept in museums, such as bricks, sheets of fabric, pieces of metal, should be modelled individually in the same way as other objects.

This class comprises distinct, delimited and coherent processes and interactions of a material nature, in cultural, social or physical systems, involving and affecting instances of E77 Persistent Item in a way characteristic of the kind of process. Typical examples are meetings, births, deaths, actions of decision taking, making or inventing things, but also more complex and extended ones such as conferences, elections, building of a castle, or battles.
While the continuous growth of a tree lacks the limits characteristic of an event, its germination from a seed does qualify as an event. Similarly, the blowing of the wind lacks the distinctness and limits of an event, but a hurricane, flood or earthquake would qualify as an event. Mental processes are considered as events, in cases where they are connected with the material externalization of their results; for example, the creation of a poem, a performance or a change of intention that becomes obvious from subsequent actions or declarations.
The effects of an instance of E5 Event may not lead to relevant permanent changes of properties or relations of the items involved in it, for example an unrecorded performance. Of course, in order to be documented, some kind of evidence for an event must exist, be it witnesses, traces or products of the event.
While instances of E4 Period always require some form of coherence between its constituent phenomena, in addition, the essential constituents of instances of E5 Event should contribute to an overall effect; for example, the statements made during a meeting and the listening of the audience.
Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an instance of E5 Event may appear as if it had an ‘instantaneous’ overall effect, but any process or interaction of material nature in reality have an extent in time and space. At a fine level, instances of E5 Event may be analysed into component phenomena and phases within a space and timeframe, and as such can be seen as a period, regardless of the size of the phenomena. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy overall effect and are thus not instances of E5 Event.

Examples:
- the birth of Cleopatra (E67) (Pomeroy, 1984)
- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (E6) (Camardo, 2013)
- World War II (E7) (Barber, 1994)
- the Battle of Stalingrad (E7) (Hoyt, 1993)
- the Yalta Conference (E7) (Harbutt, 2010)
- my birthday celebration 28-6-1995 (E7)
- the falling of a tile from my roof last Sunday (fictitious)
- the CIDOC conference 2003 (E7)

This class comprises events that destroy one or more instances of E18 Physical Thing, such that they lose their identity as the subjects of documentation.
Some destruction events are intentional, while others are independent of human activity. Intentional destruction can be documented by classifying the event as both an instance of E6 Destruction and of E7 Activity. 
The decision to document an object as destroyed, transformed, or modified is context-sensitive: 
1. If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the event is modelled solely as an instance of E6 Destruction. 
2. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the original. In this case, the new items have separate identities. Matter is preserved, but identity is not.
3. When the initial identity of the changed instance of E18 Physical Thing is preserved, the event should be documented as an instance of E11 Modification.

Examples:
- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (Camardo, 2013)
- the destruction of Nineveh (E6, E7) (River, 2016)

This class comprises those material or immaterial items to which instances of E30 Right, such as the right of ownership or use, can be applied. 
This is generally true for all instances of E18 Physical Thing. In the case of instances of E28 Conceptual Object, however, the identity of an instance of E28 Conceptual Object or the method of its use may be too ambiguous to reliably establish instances of E30 Right, as in the case of taxa and inspirations. Ownership of corporations is currently regarded as out of scope of the CIDOC CRM.

This class comprises identifiable immaterial items, such as poems, jokes, data sets, images, texts, multimedia objects, procedural prescriptions, computer program code, algorithm or mathematical formulae, that have an objectively recognizable structure and are documented as single units. The encoding structure known as a “named graph” also falls under this class, so that each “named graph” is an instance of E73 Information Object.
An instance of E73 Information Object does not depend on a specific physical carrier, which can include human memory, and it can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.
Instances of E73 Information Object of a linguistic nature should be declared as instances of the E33 Linguistic Object subclass. Instances of E73 Information Object of a documentary nature should be declared as instances of the E31 Document subclass. Conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E73 Information Object, nor are ideas without a reproducible expression.

This class comprises any gatherings or organizations of human individuals or groups that act collectively or in a similar way due to any form of unifying relationship. In the wider sense this class also comprises official positions which used to be regarded in certain contexts as one actor, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country. In such cases, it may happen that the group never had more than one member. A joint pseudonym (i.e. a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually used as a persona by two or more people) is a particular case of E74 Group.
A gathering of people becomes an instance of E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together. These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modelled as membership in an instance of E74 Group. Married couples and other concepts of family are regarded as particular examples of E74 Group.

This class comprises items that have persistent characteristics of structural nature substantially related to their identity and their integrity, sometimes known as “endurants” in philosophy. Persistent Items may be physical entities, such as people, animals or things, conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or even names. 
Instances of E77 Persistent Item may be present or be part of interactions in different periods or events. They can repeatedly be recognized at disparate occasions during their existence by characteristics of structural nature. The respective characteristics need not be exactly the same during all the existence of an instance of E77 Persistent Item. Often, they undergo gradual change, still bearing some similarities with that of previous times, or disappear completely and new emerge. For instance, a person, from the time of being born on, will gradually change all its features and acquire new ones, such as a scar. Even the DNA in different body cells will develop defects and mutations. Nevertheless, relevant characteristics used should be sufficiently similar to recognize the instance for some substantial period of time. 
The more specific criteria that determine the identity of instances of subclasses of E77 Persistent Item may vary considerably and are described or referred to in the respective scope notes. The decision about which exact criteria to use depends on whether the observable behaviour of the respective part of reality such confined conforms to the reasoning the user is interested in. For example, a building can be regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria, such as being bodily separated from other persons. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. On the opposite, the identity of a (version of a) text of a scientific publication is given by the exact arrangement of its relevant symbols. 
The main classes of objects that fall outside the scope of the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties. 
An instance of E77 Persistent Item does not require actual knowledge of the identifying features of the instance being currently known. There may be cases, where the actual identifying features of an instance of E77 Persistent Item are not decidable at a particular state of knowledge.

Examples:
- Leonardo da Vinci (E21) (Strano, 1953)
- Stonehenge (E24) (Pryor, 2016)
- the hole in the ozone layer (E4) (Hufford and Horwitz, 2005)
- the First Law of Thermodynamics (E89) (Craig and Gislason, 2002)
- the Bermuda Triangle (E53) (Dolan, 2005)

This class comprises aggregations of instances of E18 Physical Thing that are assembled and maintained (“curated” and “preserved,” in museological terminology) by one or more instances of E39 Actor over time for a specific purpose and audience, and according to a particular collection development plan. Typical instances of curated holdings are museum collections, archives, library holdings and digital libraries. A digital library is regarded as an instance of E18 Physical Thing because it requires keeping physical carriers of the electronic content.
Items may be added or removed from an E78 Curated Holding in pursuit of this plan. This class should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Curated Holding who is often referred to using the name of the E78 Curated Holding (e.g. “The Wallace Collection decided…”). 
Collective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps, or a set of chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of E78 Curated Holding. This is because they form wholes, either because they are physically bound together or because they are kept together for their functionality.

Examples:
- the John Clayton Herbarium (Blake, 1918), (Natural History Museum, 2021)
- the Wallace Collection (Ingamells, 1990)
- Mikael Heggelund Foslie’s coralline red algae Herbarium at the Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, Trondheim, Norway (Woelkerling et al., 2005)
- the Digital Collections of the Munich DigitiZation Center (MDZ) accessible via https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/ at least in January 2018.

This class comprises activities that result in an instance of E18 Physical Thing being increased, enlarged, or augmented by the addition of a part. 
Typical scenarios include the attachment of an accessory, the integration of a component, the addition of an element to an aggregate object, or the accessioning of an object into a curated instance of E78 Curated Holding. Both the E18 Physical Thing being augmented and the E18 Physical Thing that is being added are treated as separate identifiable wholes prior to the instance of E79 Part Addition. Following the addition of parts, the resulting assemblages are treated objectively as single identifiable wholes, made up of constituent or component parts bound together either physically (for example the engine becoming a part of the car), or by sharing a common purpose (such as the 32 chess pieces that make up a chess set). This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history and continuity of identity of objects that are integrated into other objects over time, such as precious gemstones being repeatedly incorporated into different items of jewellery, or cultural artefacts being added to different museum instances of E78 Curated Holding over their lifespan.

Examples:
- the setting of the Koh-I-Noor diamond into the crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (Dalrymple, 2017)
- the addition of the painting “Room in Brooklyn” by Edward Hopper to the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston
- the attachment of the bronze hand on the tree forming the Alpi Marittime [ https://giuseppepenone.com/en/words/maritime-alps] (Mangini, 2010)

This class comprises the activities that result in an instance of E18 Physical Thing being decreased by the removal of a part.
Typical scenarios include the detachment of an accessory, the removal of a component or part of a composite object, or the deaccessioning of an object from a curated collection, an instance of E78 Curated Holding. If the instance of E80 Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object into pieces, such that the whole ceases to exist, the activity should instead be modelled as an instance of E81 Transformation, i.e. a simultaneous destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity subsequent to its removal, the activity should be modelled as both an instance of E80 Part Removal and E12 Production. This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history, and continuity of identity over time, of objects that are removed from other objects, such as precious gemstones being extracted from different items of jewellery, or cultural artifacts being deaccessioned from different museum collections over their lifespan.

Examples:
- the removal of the Porite coral specimen from the Cocos Islands by Charles Darwin in April 1836 (Natural History Museum, 2021, b)
- the removal of the engine from my car (fictitious)
- the disposal of object number 1976:234 from the collection (fictitious)

This class comprises the events that result in the simultaneous destruction of one or more than one E18 Physical Thing and the creation of one or more than one E18 Physical Thing that preserves recognizable substance and structure from the first one(s) but has fundamentally different nature or identity.
Although the old and the new instances of E18 Physical Thing are treated as discrete entities having separate, unique identities, they are causally connected through the E81 Transformation; the destruction of the old E18 Physical Thing(s) directly causes the creation of the new one(s) using or preserving some relevant substance and structure. Instances of E81 Transformation are therefore distinct from re-classifications (documented using E17 Type Assignment) or modifications (documented using E11 Modification) of objects that do not fundamentally change their nature or identity. Characteristic cases are reconstructions and repurposing of historical buildings or ruins, fires leaving buildings in ruins, taxidermy of specimen in natural history.
Even though such instances of E81 Transformation are often motivated by a change of intended use, substantial material changes should justify the documentation of the result as a new instance of E18 Physical Thing and not just the change of function. The latter may be documented as an extended activity (instance of E7 Activity) of using it.

Examples:
- the mummification of Tut-Ankh-Amun (E81, E12) [the mummification of the body of the deceased is a human production process and simultaneously preserves structures of the body at and before death] (Carter and Mace 1977)
- the death, carbonization and petrification of some people of Pompeii in 79AD by the intense heat of a pyroclastic cloud and ashes from the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius (E69, E81)
- the transformation of the Hephaisteion temple in Athens, better known as “Theseion”, into a Christian church, dedicated to Saint George <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George> around AD 700 (E81,E12) [which actually helped preserving part of the antique temple structure from 449BC]

It is typically a rigorous scholarly or scientific process that ensures a type is exhaustively described and appropriately named. In some cases, particularly in archaeology and the life sciences, E83 Type Creation requires the identification of an exemplary specimen and the publication of the type definition in an appropriate scholarly forum. The activity modelled as an instance of E83 Type Creation is central to research in the life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a “taxon,” the type description as a “protologue,” and the exemplary specimens as “original element” or “holotype”.

This class comprises the activities that contribute to the management and the preservation and evolution of instances of E78 Curated Holding, following an implicit or explicit curation plan. 
It specializes the notion of activity into the curation of a collection and allows the history of curation to be recorded.
Items are accumulated and organized following criteria such as subject, chronological period, material type, style of art, etc., and can be added or removed from an instance of E78 Curated Holding for a specific purpose and/or audience. The initial aggregation of items to form a collection is regarded as an instance of E12 Production Event, while the activities of evolving, preserving, and promoting a collection are regarded as instances of E87 Curation Activity.

Examples:

This class comprises transfers of legal ownership from one or more instances of E39 Actor to one or more other instances of E39 Actor. 
The class also applies to the establishment or loss of ownership of instances of E18 Physical Thing. It does not, however, imply changes of any other kinds of rights. The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E8 Acquisition there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances, it may describe:
1. the beginning of ownership
2. the end of ownership
3. the transfer of ownership
4. the acquisition from an unknown source
5. the loss of title due to destruction of the item
It may also describe events where a collector appropriates legal title, for example, by annexation or field collection. The interpretation of the museum notion of “accession” differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership (E8 Acquisition) and physical custody (E10 Transfer of Custody) separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.

Examples:
- the collection of a hammerhead shark, genus Sphyrna (Carchariniformes), by John Steinbeck and Edward Ricketts at Puerto Escondido in the Gulf of Mexico on 25(th) March 1940. (Steinbeck, 2000)
- the acquisition of El Greco’s “The Apostles Peter and Paul” by the State Hermitage in Saint Petersburg. (https://hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/32730)
- the loss of my stuffed Fringilla coelebs due to insect damage last year (fictitious)

This class comprises identifiable symbols and any aggregation of symbols, such as characters, identifiers, traffic signs, emblems, texts, data sets, images, musical scores, multimedia objects, computer program code, or mathematical formulae that have an objectively recognizable structure and that are documented as single units.
It includes sets of signs of any nature, which may serve to designate something, or to communicate some propositional content. An instance of E90 Symbolic Object may or may not have a specific meaning, for example an arbitrary character string.
In some cases, the content of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object may completely be represented by a serialized digital content model, such as a sequence of ASCII-encoded characters, an XML or HTML document, or a TIFF image. The property P3 has note and its subproperty P190 has symbolic content allow for the description of this content model. In order to disambiguate which symbolic level is the carrier of the meaning, the property P3.1 has type can be used to specify the encoding (e.g. “bit”, “Latin character”, RGB pixel).

Examples:
- ‘ecognizabl’
- the “no-smoking” sign (E36)
- “BM000038850.JPG” (E41) [identifies a digital image] (Natural History Museum, 2021)

This class comprises 4-dimensional point sets (volumes) in physical spacetime (in contrast to mathematical models of it) regardless of their true geometric forms. They may derive their identity from being the extent of a material phenomenon or from being the interpretation of an expression defining an extent in spacetime. Intersections of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, E53 Place, and E52 Time-Span are also regarded as instances of E92 Spacetime Volume. An instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is either contiguous or composed of a finite number of contiguous subsets. Its boundaries may be fuzzy due to the properties of the phenomena it derives from or due to the limited precision up to which defining expression can be identified with a real extent in spacetime. The duration of existence of an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is its projection on time.

Examples:
- the extent in space and time of the Event of Caesar’s murder (Irwin, 1935)
- where and when the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 took place (Kouwenhoven, 1997)
- the spatio-temporal trajectory of the H.M.S. Victory from its building to its actual location (Goodwin, 2015)

This class comprises instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, whose temporal extent has been chosen in order to determine the spatial extent of a phenomenon over the chosen time-span. Respective phenomena may, for instance, be historical events or periods, but can also be the diachronic extent and existence of physical things. In other words, instances of this class fix a slice of another instance of E92 Spacetime Volume in time. 
The temporal extent of an instance of E93 Presence typically is predetermined by the researcher so as to focus the investigation particularly on finding the spatial extent of the phenomenon by testing for its characteristic features. There are at least two basic directions such investigations might take. The investigation may wish to determine where something was during some time or it may wish to reconstruct the total passage of a phenomenon’s spacetime volume through an examination of discrete presences. Observation and measurement of features indicating the presence or absence of a phenomenon in some space allows for the progressive approximation of spatial extents through argumentation typically based on inclusion, exclusion and various overlaps.

This class comprises the units in which a monetary system, supported by an administrative authority or other community, quantifies and arithmetically compares all monetary amounts declared in the unit. The unit of a monetary system must describe a nominal value which is kept constant by its administrative authority and an associated banking system if it exists, and not by market value. For instance, one may pay with grams of gold, but the respective monetary amount would have been agreed as the gold price in US dollars on the day of the payment. Under this definition, British Pounds, U.S. Dollars, and European Euros are examples of currency, but “grams of gold” is not. One monetary system has one and only one currency. Instances of this class must not be confused with coin denominations, such as “Dime” or “Sestertius”. Non-monetary exchange of value in terms of quantities of a particular type of goods, such as cows, do not constitute a currency.

This class comprises types that stand as the models for instances of E22 Human-Made Object that are produced as the result of production activities using plans exact enough to result in one or more series of uniform, functionally and aesthetically identical and interchangeable items. The product type is the intended ideal form of the manufacture process. It is typical of instances of E22 Human-Made Object that conform to an instance of E99 Product Type that its component parts are interchangeable with component parts of other instances of E22 Human-Made Object made after the model of the same instance of E99 Product Type. Frequently, the uniform production according to a given instance of E99 Product Type is achieved by creating individual tools, such as moulds or print plates that are themselves carriers of the design of the product type. Modern tools may use the flexibility of electronically controlled devices to achieve such uniformity. The product type itself, i.e. the potentially unlimited series of aesthetically equivalent items, may be the target of artistic design, rather than the individual object. In extreme cases, only one instance of a product type may have been produced, such as in a “print on demand” process which was only triggered once. However, this should not be confused with industrial prototypes, such as car prototypes, which are produced prior to the production line being set up, or test the production line itself.

Note, that the class E9 Move inherits the property P7 took place at (witnessed): E53 Place.

Moves may also be documented to consist of other moves (via P9 consists of (forms part of)), in order to describe intermediate stages on a trajectory. In that case, start and end points of the partial moves should match appropriately between each other and with the overall event.

Typically, an instance of A1 Excavation Processing Unit would be terminated if significant discontinuities of substance or finds come to light, or if the activity is interrupted due to external factors, such as end of a working day. In other cases, the termination would be based on predefined physical specifications, such as the boundaries of a maximal volume of matter to be excavated in one unit of excavation.
Depending on the methodology, an instance of A1 Excavation Processing Unit may intend to remove matter only within the boundaries of a particular stratigraphic unit, or it may follow a pre-declared spatial extent such as a trench. It may only uncover, clean or expose a structure or parts of it.
The process of excavation results in the production of a set of recorded (documentation) data that should be sufficient to provide researchers enough information regarding the consistency and spatial distribution of the excavated Segment of Matter and things and features embedded in it. Some parts or all of the removed physical material (instances of S11 Amount of Matter) may be dispersed, whereas others may be kept in custody in the form of finds or samples, while others (such as parts of walls) may be left at the place of their discovery. The data produced by an instance of A1 Excavation Processing Unit should pertain to the material state of matter at excavation time only and should be clearly distinguished from subsequent interpretation about the causes for this state of matter.
The current class A1 Excavation Processing Unit is somewhat overloaded and may be split into two subclasses, one for the intellectual process and one for the physical process. This is left for a future refinement of the model.

Examples:
- The activity taking place on 21.9.2007 between 12:00 and 13:00 that excavated the Stratigraphic Volume Unit “(2)” of Figure 4 and created the surface “S1” 
- The activity that excavated the first 20 cm of a spit excavation on 21.7.2007 created the surface “S2” in Figure 4.

This class comprises instances of A8 Stratigraphic Unit, which are coherent parts of a boundary surface that appear as the result of a stratigraphic genesis event or process. The interface marks the limit of the geometric extent of the effect of a genesis or modification event, and indicates in particular where the effect of this event ended. Each event of creation or destruction of a deposition layer implies the creation of new interfaces. Thus, there are two main types of interfaces: those that are surfaces of strata (that can be directly related to the corresponding stratum via the AP12 confines property), and those that are only surfaces, formed by the removal or destruction of existing stratifications.

Examples:
- the Stratigraphic Interface number “[19]” confining the Stratigraphic Volume Unit number “(2)” in Figure 6

This class comprises activities or processes that have produced homogeneous, distinguishable units of stratification that are in a relatively stable form from the time of their genesis until they are observed. Such processes may be the aggregation of cycles of erosion/destruction, deposit/accumulation, or transformation/modification occurring on a particular site throughout a particular period of time. These processes are usually not only due to natural forces (i.e., climate, the impact of flora and fauna, other natural events), but also to human activities, in particular excavation and construction. An event of stratification genesis typically produces two main forms of stratification units, both a deposit and an interface.

Examples:
- the production of the stratigraphic interface “[3]” by the cut in the pre-existing strata of the posthole –see Figure 6
- the production of the stratigraphic unit volume “(18)” via the filling of the posthole with detritus or some other matter –see Figure 6
- the creation of the one-meter-thick level of pumice caused by the Minoan eruption of Thera and consisting of five distinct layers, which covers the ruins at the excavation Akrotiri, Thera –see Figure 9 (Doumas et al., 2015)
- the creation of the 8-10-metre-thick level of successive layers volcanic ash deposed on top of the one-meter-thick level of pumice, which covers the ruins at the excavation Akrotiri, Thera—see Figure 9 (Doumas et al., 2015)
- the production of the deposits L14-L18 and L22-L24 by at least seven (7) distinct fill episodes of a neolithic ditch, observed at the northern section of Trenches 6 and 21, at the site Paliambela, Kolindros–see Figure 10

This class comprises instances of A8 Stratigraphic Unit partially or completely embedding one or more instances of E20 Physical Thing and at a particular position with relative stability in one or more instances of A2 Stratigraphic Volume Units. Normally, an embedding is expected to have been stable from the time of generation of the first instance of A2 Stratigraphic Volume Unit that surrounds it. However, it may also be due to later intrusion. As an empirical fact, the expert may only be able to decide that a particular embedding is not recent, i.e. has been persisting for longer than the activity that encountered it. This class can be used to document the fact of embedding generally with respect to the surrounding matter or, more specifically, with respect to a more precise position within this matter.

Examples:
- the pottery vessels embedded within the deposit on the ground floor of the West House at Akrotiri, Thera [The pottery vessels were discovered during the excavation process of Room 6 of the West House at Akrotiri –see Figure 8] (Michailidou, 2001)
- San Galgano’s sword embedded at the Hermitage of Monte Siepi [He retired around 1170 to live as a hermit. As a symbol of peace, he embedded his sword in a stone, which can still be seen today] (Wikipedia, 2023) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galgano_Guidotti>

This class comprises instances of S20 Rigid Physical Features which appear as the result of a stratigraphic genesis event or process. The form of an instance of A8 Stratigraphic Unit should be of a kind that can be attributed to a single genesis event or process and has the potential to be observed. One genesis event may have created more than one SU. An instance of A8 Stratigraphic Unit is regarded to exist as long as a part of its matter is still in place with respect to a surrounding reference space, such that its spatial features can be associated with effects of the genesis process of interest.
This also implies that a certain degree of coherent (“conformal”) deformation is tolerable within its time-span of existence. Therefore, the place an instance of A8 Stratigraphic Unit occupies can be uniquely identified with respect to the surrounding reference space of archaeological interest

Examples:
- post holes “[7]” and “[8]” (A3) in Figure 4 
- the one-meter-thick level of pumice caused by the Minoan eruption of Thera, which consists of five distinct layers and covers the ruins at the excavation Akrotiri, Thera –see Figure 9 (Doumas et al., 2015)

This class comprises fixed amounts of matter specified as some air, some water, some soil, etc., defined by the total and integrity of their material content. In order to be able to identify and recognize in practice one instance of S11 Amount of Matter, some sort of confinement is needed that serves as a constraint for the enclosed matter and the integrity of the content, such as a bottle. In contrast to instances of E18 Physical Thing, no stability of form is required. The content may be put into another bottle without losing its identity. Subclasses may define very different identity conditions for the integrity of the content, such as chemical composition, or the sequence of layers of a bore core. Whereas an instance of E18 Physical Thing may gradually change form and chemical composition while preserving its identity, such as living beings, an instance of S11 Amount of Matter may lose its identifying features by such processes. What matters for the identity of an instance of S1 Amount of Matter is the preservation of a relevant composition from the initial state of definition onwards.

This class comprises a mass of matter in fluid form environmentally constraint in some persistent form allowing for identifying it for the management or research of material phenomena, such as a part of the sea, a river, the atmosphere or the milk in a bottle. Fluids are generally defined by the continuity criterion which is characteristic of their substance: their amorphous matter is continuous and tends to flow. Therefore, contiguous amounts of matter within a fluid body may stay contiguous or at least be locally spatially confined for a sufficiently long time in order to be temporarily identified and traced. This is a much weaker concept of stability of form than the one we would apply to what one would call a physical object. In general, an instance of Fluid Body may gain or lose matter over time through so-called sources or sinks in its surface, in contrast to physical things, which may lose or gain matter by exchange of pieces such as spare parts or corrosion.

This class comprises instances of E5 Event or S10 Material Substantial (i.e. items or phenomena, such as physical things, their behaviour, states and interactions or events), that can be observed by measurement or detection devices or by human sensory impression including when enhanced by tools.
In order to be observable, instances of E5 Event must consist of some interaction or action of material substance. In some cases, the spatiotemporal confinement of the event itself, such as a flash, a car stopping etc. marks the limits of a documented observation of an event. In other cases, such as the situation of a car passing by a certain object, the spatiotemporal limits of the event of observing itself, as well as the direction of attention or the orientation of used instruments, may constrain the observed detail of a larger process, e.g., noticing the sight of a car passing by; a light emission, etc.
Conceptual objects manifest through their carriers such as books, digital media, or even human memory. Attributes of conceptual objects, such as number of words, can be observed on their carriers. If the respective properties between carriers differ, either they carry different instances of conceptual objects or the difference can be attributed to accidental deficiencies in one of the carriers. In that sense even immaterial objects are observable. By this model we address the fact that frequently, the actually observed carriers of conceptual objects are not explicitly identified in documentation, i.e., they are assumed to have existed but they are unknown as individuals.

Examples:
- the domestic goose from Guangdong/1/1996 (H5N1) that was identified in 1996 in farmed geese in southern China as circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 (E20) (Wan, 2012)
- the flight of a male Bearded Vulture observed near Loukia, Heraklion, Crete in the morning of the 24(th) of October 2020 (E5) [The Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus Barbatus) is a threatened species in Crete] (Claes, 2020)
- the eruption of Krakatoa volcano at Indonesia in 1883 (E5) (Symons et al., 1888)

This class comprises activities of S4 Observation (substance) where an E39 Actor encounters an instance of E18 Physical Thing of a kind relevant for the mission of the observation or regarded as potentially relevant for some community (identity). This observation produces knowledge about the existence of the respective thing at a particular place in or on surrounding matter. This knowledge may be new to the group of people the actor belongs to. In that case we would talk about a discovery. The observer may recognize or assign an individual identity of the thing encountered or regard only the type as noteworthy in the associated documentation or report.
In archaeology there is a particular interest if an object is found “in situ”, i.e. if its embedding in the surrounding matter supports the assumption that the object was not moved since the archaeologically relevant deposition event. The surrounding matter with the relative position of the object in it as well as the absolute position and time of the observation may be recorded in order to enable inferences about the history of the object.
In Biology, additional parameters may be recorded like the kind of ecosystem, if the biological individual survives the observation, what detection or catching devices have been used or if the encounter event supported the detection of a new biological kind (“taxon”).

Examples:
- the finding, by Prof. Stampolidis, of a complete skeleton, in situ, at the site of Eleutherna during the archaeological excavation carried out by the University of Crete in 2007 (S19) (Bonn-Muller, 2010)
- the detection of lagocephalos_Sceleratus was carried out with the trawler 419 in the Mediteranean sea, during the first week of August 2014 (S19) (Bekiari et al., 2014)
- the encounter of the marble floor of the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum during the digging of a well in 1750 (S19) (Sider, 1990, p. 536)

The removed matter may acquire a persistent identity of different nature beyond the act of its removal, such as becoming a physical object in the narrower sense. Such cases should be modeled by using multiple instantiation with adequate concepts of creating the respective items.

Any instance of this class is a physical feature with sufficient stability of form in itself and with respect to the physical object bearing it in order to associate a permanent reference space within which its form is invariant and at rest. The maximum volume in space that an instance of S20 Rigid Physical Feature occupies defines uniquely a place for the feature with respect to its surrounding matter.
Therefore we model S20 Rigid Physical Feature as a subclass of E26 Physical Feature and of E53 Place. The latter is intended as a phenomenal place as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss positions relative to the extent of an instance of S20 Rigid Physical Feature without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated place. However, since the identity and existence of this place depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of S20 Rigid Physical Feature as matter, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language. It shortcuts an implicit self-referential path from E26 Physical Feature through P156 occupies, E53 Place, P157 is at rest relative to E26 Physical Feature.
In cases of instances of S20 Rigid Physical Feature on or in the surface of earth, the default reference is typically fixed to the closer environment of the tectonic plate or sea floor. In cases of features on mobile objects, the reference space is typically fixed to the geometry of the bearing object. Note that the reference space associated with the instance of S20 Rigid Physical Feature may quite well be deformed over time, as long the continuity of its topology does not become unclear, such as the compression of dinosaur bones in geological layers, or the distortions of the hull of a ship by the waves of the sea. Defined in this way, the reference space can be used as a means to infer from current topological relationships past topological relationships of interest.

This class comprises physical features with relative stability of form and structure within a declared spatial volume of interest. The spatial extent of an instance of S22 Segment of Matter may be declared or defined by a researcher or observer usually because the arrangement and composition of substance is characteristic for the surrounding matter or can be interpreted as traces of its genesis and subsequent internal and external processes it was exposed to. The defining spatial extent is typically declared on a continuous matter by means of geometric determination without observable boundaries on all sides or any side. It may however be extracted at some point in time along the declared boundaries.
An instance of S22 Segment of Matter is regarded to be existing from the time on it completely solidified with a structure that is still preserved in a recognizable way at the time of its spatial definition. Its existence is regarded to end when its respective integrity is partially or completely corrupted. Uncorrupted subsections of an instance of S22 Segment of Matter may continue to exist as segments of matter in their own right beyond the existence of the containing instance, and may have solidified before it.
Typical examples are segments of archaeological or geological layers. They are regarded as uncorrupted even if they have undergone conformal deformations, such as compressions or shifts, as long as the effects of these deformations do not destroy the relevant structures of interest. This means that the defining spatial volume may be only geometrically valid for an instant of time for which it was declared, and undergo before and after deformations. In some cases, it may be possible to calculate the initial volume at the time of solidification, for instance for petrified bones compressed in Jurassic layers.

- the clay floor A11 [Heterogeneous, yellow to grey silty clay; clear, wavy lower boundary] (illu p. 1601, Croix et al, 2019)

This class comprises activities of determining positions in space and time. The determined position is intended to approximate a part or all of the extent of the presence (instance of E93 Presence) of an instance of E18 Physical Thing or E4 Period of interest, such as the outer walls of an excavated settlement, the position of a ship sailing or the start and end of athlete's run in a competition. Characteristically, a theodolite or GPS device may be positioned on some persistent feature. Determining the position of the device will yield an approximation of the position of the feature of interest. Alternatively, some material item may be observed moving through a determined position at a given time.
This class does not inherit properties from class S21 Measurement. A position determination is an evaluation of a combination of measurement of multiple associated distances and/or angles (instances of E54 Dimension) from a particular spot to certain reference points of previously known position in the same reference space. A particular role is played by the Earth's magnetic field and rotational axis as reference for an angle or direction. Often, the observed constituting dimensions are not documented, or hidden in an electronic device software. The determined position is given as an E94 Space Primitive corresponding to a declarative place. Together with the measured time-span covering the time-critical observations it forms a spacetime volume, which should normally overlap with the spatiotemporal extent of the thing or phenomenon of interest.

Examples:
- the determination of the position of the Titanic for the initial distress call after hitting an iceberg (S23) [The iceberg was hit on 14 April 1912 at 23:40 ship’s time. The subsequent position determination was likely done by Capt. Edward Smith and was transmitted 15 April 1912 at 00:27.] (Halpern, 2011)
- the determination of the position of the Titanic by officer Joseph G. Boxhall after the initial distress signal was sent (S23) [done between 00:27 and 00:35, when Boxhall showed the coordinates to Smith] (Halpern, 2011)
- the determination of the position of the Titanic by Robert Ballard's team after the Titanic ship-wreck was found (S23) (Ballard et al., 1987)
- Samuel Halpern’s 2007 determination of the position of the Titanic at the time of the collision (S23) [based on the position of the ship-wreck] (Halpern, 2007)

This class comprises the activity of gaining scientific knowledge about particular states of physical reality through empirical evidence, experiments and measurements.
We define observation in the sense of natural sciences, as a kind of human activity: at some place and within some time-span, certain physical things and their behavior and interactions are observed by human sensory impression, and often enhanced by tools and measurement devices.
Observed situations or dimensions may pertain to properties confined to a single instance of S15 Observable Entity or pertain to constellations of multiple instances and relations between them, in particular distances between them.
The output of the internal processes of measurement devices that do not require additional human interaction are in general regarded as part of the observation and not as additional inference. Primary data from measurement devices are regarded in this model to be results of observation and can be interpreted as propositions believed to be true within the (known) tolerances and degree of reliability of the device.
Measurements and witnessing of events are special cases of observations. Observations result in a belief that certain propositions held at a time within the time-span of the observation. In this model, the degree of confidence in the observed properties is regarded to be “true” by default, but could be described differently by adding a property P3 has note to an instance of S4 Observation

Examples:
- the excavation of unit XI by the Archaeological Institute of Crete in 2004 (S4)
- the excavation (S4) in the NE section of the central court of the Knossos palace by the Ephorate of Antiquities of Heraklion in 1997 (S4) (Επιστημονική Επιτροπή Κνωσού, 2008)
- the observation of the density of the X-Ray image of cupid's head from the painting ‘Cupid complaining to Venus’ as ‘high density’, on the 19th of March 1963 (S4) (The National Gallery, London, 1963).
- the observation of visible light absorption of the painting ‘Cupid complaining to Venus’ as ‘having red pigment’, in 2015 (S4) (Foister, 2015)
