    "@value" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises associations between an instance of any class, and signs or arrangements of signs that are used to refer to and identify that instance.\nSigns include alphanumeric characters, ideograms, notations such as chemical structure symbols, sound symbols, etc. The scripts or type sets for the symbols used to compose an instance of F12 Nomen have to be sufficiently specified. Spelling variants are regarded as different nomens, whereas the use of different fonts (visual representation variants) or different digital encodings do not change the identity.\nAn arbitrary combination of signs or symbols cannot be regarded as an appellation or designation until it is associated with something in some context. In that sense, the F12 Nomen class can be understood as the reification of a relationship between an instance of E1 CRM Entity and an instance of E41 Appellation. Two instances of F12 Nomen can happen to be associated with equivalent strings and yet remain distinct, as long as they refer to distinct instances of E1 CRM Entity. Furthermore, two instances of F12 Nomen referring to the same instance of E1 CRM Entity may be associated with equivalent strings, and remain distinct as long as they are associated with distinct properties of the F12 Nomen class (for example, having the same spelling in different languages, or being defined in different controlled vocabularies).\nAn instance of F12 Nomen associates a combination of signs with an instance of E1 CRM Entity on the basis of a cultural or linguistic convention: by associating a string with anything, the instance of F12 Nomen establishes a meaning that is not inherent in the instance of E62 String that is associated with it. Depending on context of use, nomens associated with equivalent strings can be associated with instances of different things in the real world even within the same language (polysemy and homonymy). Conversely, the same thing can be referred to through any number of nomens (synonymy). In the controlled environment of a bibliographic information system, though, homonymy is avoided.\nInstances of F12 Nomen are assigned and associated with instances of E1 CRM Entity either formally (such as by bibliographic agencies) or informally through common usage. When they are assigned formally, the construction of the instances of E62 String that represent them may follow predetermined rules.\n\nExamples:\n- ‘杜甫’ as the name for a Chinese poet of the 8(th) century, rendered in simplified Chinese characters\n- ‘Du Fu’ as the name for a Chinese poet of the 8(th) century, rendered in Pinyin romanised form\n- ‘Tu Fu’ as the name for a Chinese poet of the 8(th) century, rendered in another romanised form\n- ‘Thơ Ðô Phủ’ as the name for a Chinese poet of the 8(th) century, rendered in a Vietnamese form\n- ‘جامعة صفاقس’ as the name for Sfax University (Tunisia), rendered in Arabic in Arabic script\n- ‘Ğāmi‘at̀̀ Ṣafāqis’ as the name for Sfax University (Tunisia), rendered in transliterated Arabic\n- ‘Université de Sfax’ as the name for Sfax University (Tunisia), rendered in French\n- ‘3-[(2S)-1-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl]pyridine’ as the term for nicotine, rendered in the IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry\n- ‘Murders in the rue Morgue’ as the title of the textual work by Edgar Allan Poe, in English\n- ‘Poe, Edgar Allan, 1809-1849.

The substance of F2 Expression is signs.\nAn Expression is the outcome of the intellectual or creative process of realizing a Work. Subsequent expressions conveying the same work may be created over time.\nExpressions do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. As far as bibliographic practice is concerned, only instances of F2 Expression that are externalised on physical carriers other than both the creator’s brain and an auditor’s brain are taken into account.\nThe form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression. Differences in form imply different Expressions (e.g., from text to spoken word, a transcript of a recording). Similarly, differences in language or means of performance imply different Expressions (e.g., translations or arrangements for different instruments). Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the result is considered to be a new F2 Expression. While theoretically any change in signs will result in a new Expression, conventionally the context and use will determine the rules for distinguishing among expressions.\nAn instance of F2 Expression which includes spoken or written text may be multiply instantiated as an instance of E33 Linguistic Object. This allows for the association of the E56 Language of the text with the instance of F2 Expression by using the property P72 has language (is language of).\n\nExamples:\n- the original text (in English) by Agatha Christie for her novel ‘Murder on the Orient Express’\n- the German text of ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ (as translated by Elisabeth van Bebber and published with the title ‘Mord im Orientexpress’)\n- the text of the abridged English version of ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ (as published by HarperCollins)\n- the narrated English text of ‘Murder on the Orient Express’ by David Suchet\n- the English text of Homer’s ‘Odyssey’ translated by Robert Fagles\n- the English text of Homer’s ‘Odyssey’ translated by Richmond Lattimore\n- ‘Dewey Decimal Classification’, 23rd edition (DDC23) [English edition]\n- ‘Classification décimale de Dewey’, 23e édition [French translation of DDC23]\n- the performance of Bach’s ‘Goldberg Variations’ by Angela Hewitt at St. Thomas Church (Leipzig Germany) in November 2020\n- the performance of Bach’s ‘Goldberg Variations’ by Angela Hewitt in Christuskirche (Berlin) on 14-17 December 2015\n- the musical score for Bach’s ‘Goldberg Variations’ (as published by Balthasar Schmid in 1741)\n- Beethoven’s original score for Symphony No. 9 (as expressed by Beethoven’s original hand-written manuscript held by the Berlin State Library)\n- the score for Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 that was edited by Jonathan Del Mar and published by Bärenreiter in 1997\n- the original cut of Hitchcock’s movie ‘Psycho’\n- the censored version of Hitchcock’s movie ‘Psycho’ that was released in Britain (with stabbing sounds and visible nude shots removed)\n- the first plaster version of ‘The Thinker’ sculpture made by Auguste Rodin around 1881\n- large scale version of Auguste Rodin’s ‘The Thinker’ created at the Fonderie Alexis Rudier in 1904\n"

The substance of F3 Manifestation is not only signs, but also the manner in which they are presented to be consumed by users, including the kind of media adopted.\nAn F3 Manifestation is the outcome of a publication process where one or more F2 Expressions are prepared for public dissemination, but it may also be a unique form created directly on some material carrier without the intent of being formally published.\nAn instance of F3 Manifestation typically incorporates one or more instances of F2 Expression representing a distinct logical content and all additional input by a publisher such as text layout and cover design. Additionally an F3 Manifestation can be identified by the physical features for the medium of distribution, if applicable. For example, publications in the form of hard-cover and paperback editions would be two distinct instances of F3 Manifestation, even though authorial and editorial content are otherwise identical in both publications.\nIn the case of industrial products such as printed books or music CDs, but also digital material, an instance of F3 Manifestation can be regarded as the prototype for all copies of it. In these cases, an instance of F3 Manifestation specifies all of the features or traits that instances of F5 Item display in order to be copies of a particular publication. In the case of industrial products, instances of F3 Manifestation are also instances of E99 Product Type, normally nowadays identified by characteristic identifiers such as ISBN numbers.\n\nExamples:\n- the publication ‘Murder on the Orient Express / Agatha Christie’, published by Collins Crime Club in 1934\n- the publication of ‘Murder on the Orient Express / Agatha Christie’, published by HarperCollins in 2017\n- the publication ‘Mord im Orientexpress : ein Hercule-Poirot-Roman / Agatha Christie’, published by Deutscher Bücherbund in 1975\n- the publication ‘Murder on The Orient Express / Agatha Christie’, narrated by David Suchet, audio book (audio CD) published by HarperCollins in 2005\n- the HTML-version of Homer’s ‘Odyssey’ with English text by S.

Groups that are constituted as meetings, conferences, congresses, expeditions, festivals, fairs, etc. are examples of F55 Collective Agent as long as they self-identify by a specific name, rather than being referred to by a generic description of the gathering, and can act as a unit (such as by publishing their proceedings, or approving a report). These collective actions may be performed by representatives selected by the whole, rather than by all individual members acting together.\nCollective Agents may be members of other Collective Agents, although directly or indirectly all Collective Agents are composed of persons. The membership of many types of Collective Agents will continue to evolve over time. A Collective Agent may continue to exist even if it has no members for a time (for example, a committee whose members all resign prior to the expiration of their terms but then a new complement of members is appointed).\nInstances of F55 Collective Agent include instances of its subclass F11 Corporate Body: commercial or corporate entities and other legally registered bodies, as well as organizations and associations, musical, artistic or performing groups, governments, and any of their sub-units.\nMarried couples and other concepts of family (instances of F39 Family) are instances of a subclass of F55 Collective Agent.\nIn the wider sense, this class also comprises holders of official positions viewed collectively, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country. In such cases, it is possible that the instance of F55 Collective Agent has only ever had a single member.\nA group of persons known by/using a joint pseudonym (i.e., a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually adopted as a persona by two or more people acting together) is a case of F55 Collective Agent.\n\nExamples:\n- International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (F11)\n- 81st World Library and Information Conference (F11)\n- Bibliothèque nationale de France (F11)\n- Exxon-Mobil (F11)\n- The Beatles (F11)\n- the brothers Grimm (F39)\n- the President of the Swiss Confederation\n- Nicolas Bourbaki [collective pseudonym of a group of 20(th) century French mathematicians also known as the ‘Association des collaborateurs de Nicolas Bourbaki’]\n- Ellery Queen [joint pseudonym for detective fiction of cousins Frederic Dannay and Manfred Bennington Less who also wrote separately]\n"

As a result, all the instances of F5 Item associated with a given instance of F3 Manifestation are expected to carry the content defined in that instance of F3 Manifestation, although some or even all of them may happen to carry a content that significantly differs from it, due to either an accident in the course of industrial production, or subsequent physical modification or degradation.\nAn instance of F5 Item that consists of a physical object or set of objects with clear physical boundaries is also an instance of E22 Human-Made Object. An instance of F5 Item that is stored on a part of a larger physical support (such as an electronic file among others on a disc) can also be considered to be an instance of E25 Human-Made Feature.\nThe notion of F5 Item is only relevant with regard to the production process, from a bibliographic point of view. The physical units managed by cultural heritage institutions in their holdings are a distinct notion: a unit of holdings certainly can be equal to an instance of F5 Item, but it also can be either “bigger” than one (e.g., when two instances of F5 Item are bound together (in the case of printed books)), or “smaller” than one (e.g., for incomplete holdings, such as when only one CD from a two-CD set is held). From an operational point of view, cultural heritage institutions typically do not manage instances of F5 Item, but physical holdings units, instances of E19 Physical Object, although for libraries in most cases this is not significant because each item corresponds with a single unit.

Typically instances of E90 Symbolic Object that are of interest as fragments of expressions are formed deliberately, such as when excerpts are taken from a text by the compiler of a collection of excerpts, or citations from one expression are used in another text.\n\nExamples:\n- The ancient Greek text of the four stanzas from an ode by Sappho (E33) that were quoted by Pseudo-Longinus in his textual work entitled ‘On the sublime’ is fragment of the complete ancient Greek text, now irremediably lost, of Sappho’s ode currently identified as Sappho’s poem #2 (F2).\n- The phrase ‘Beati pauperes spiritu’ (E33) is fragment of the Latin text of the Gospel according to St. Matthew (F2). [excerpt from Matthew 5,3]\n- The stanza ‘Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita / mi ritrovai per una selva oscura / ché la diritta via era smarrita’ (E33) is fragment of the Italian text of Dante Alighieri’s ‘Inferno’ from the ‘Divina Commedia’ (F2).\n- The widely recognized ominous four-note opening motif (E73) is fragment of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony (F2).\n- The melting clock (E36) is fragment of the painting ‘Persistence of Memory’ by Salvador Dali, 1931 (F2).\n"

    "@value" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises transfers of the physical custody or the legal responsibility for the physical custody of objects. The recording of the donor or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E10 Transfer of Custody there is either no donor or no recipient. \nDepending on the circumstances, it may describe: \n1. the beginning of custody (there is no previous custodian)\n2. the end of custody (there is no subsequent custodian)\n3. the transfer of custody (transfer from one custodian to the next)\n4. the receipt of custody from an unknown source (the previous custodian is unknown)\n5. the declared loss of an object (the current or subsequent custodian is unknown)\nIn the event that only a single kind of transfer of custody occurs, either the legal responsibility for the custody or the actual physical possession of the object but not both, this difference should be expressed using the property \nP2 has type (is type of).\nThe sense of physical possession requires that the object of custody be in the hands of the keeper at least with a part representative for the whole. The way, in which a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps a part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept instance of E18 Physical Thing.\nThe interpretation of the museum notion of \"accession\" differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these. \nTheft is a specific case of illegal transfer of custody.\n\nExamples:\n- the delivery of the paintings by Secure Deliveries Inc. to the National Gallery\n- the return of Picasso’s “Guernica” to Madrid’s Prado in 1981 (Chipp, 1988)\n- the transfer of custody of the work described as “Von der Velden ein Ufer an der See” from Johann Matthäus von Merian to the Auction House Heldevier (Jacob) for the purpose of sale, ca. 1716\n- the transfer of custody of the painting ‘Mrs. Fitzherbert’ to the art dealer Knoedler from Parke-Bernet Galleries (New York, NY, USA) ca. March 1941\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E10(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n"

An event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities.\nAn activity undertaken on an object which was designed to alter it, but which, in fact, it did not in any seemingly significant way (such as the application of a solvent during conservation which failed to dissolve any part of the object), is still considered as an instance of E11 Modification. Typically, any such activity will leave at least forensic traces of evidence on the object.\nIf the instance of E29 Design or Procedure utilized for the modification prescribes the use of specific materials, they should be documented using property P68 foresees use of (use foreseen by): E57 Material of E29 Design or Procedure, rather than via P126 employed (was employed in): E57 Material.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the SS Great Britain (E12) (Gregor, 1971)\n- the impregnation of the Vasa warship in Stockholm for preservation after 1956 (Håfors, 2010)\n- the transformation of the Enola Gay into a museum exhibit by the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC between 1993 and 1995 (E12, E81) (Yakel, 2000)\n- the last renewal of the gold coating of the Toshogu shrine in Nikko, Japan (Cali and Dougil, 2012)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E11(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n"

In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one. \nThis entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event. \nAn event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals.

Note that all instances of properties described in a knowledge base are the opinion of someone. Per default, they are the opinion of the team maintaining the knowledge base. This fact must not individually be registered for all instances of properties provided by the maintaining team, because it would result in an endless recursion of whose opinion was the description of an opinion. Therefore, the use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment marks the fact that the maintaining team is in general neutral to the validity of the respective assertion, but registers someone else’s opinion and how it came about.\nAll properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly relating the respective pair of items or concepts. Multiple use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment may possibly lead to a collection of contradictory values.\n\nExamples:\n- the examination of MS Sinai Greek 418 by Nicholas Pickwoad in November 2003 (Honey & Pickwoad, 2010)\n- the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr’s silver cup in February 1997 (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E13(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n"

It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as “preferred identifier assignment”, to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment through the P2 has type (is type of) property.\n\nExamples:\n- replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17(th) century lamentation cloth at the Museum Benaki, Athens\n- assigning the author and uniform title heading “Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832.

Methods and devices employed should be associated with instances of E16 Measurement by properties such as P33 used specific technique: E29 Design or Procedure, P125 used object of type: E55 Type, P16 used specific object (was used for): E70 Thing, whereas basic techniques such as \"carbon-14 dating\" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of): E55 Type. Details of methods and devices reused or reusable in other instances of E16 Measurement should be documented for these entities rather than the measurements themselves, whereas details of particular execution may be documented by free text or by instantiating adequate sub-activities, if the detail may be of interest for an overarching query.\nRegardless whether a measurement is made by an instrument or by human senses, it represents the initial transition from physical reality to information without any other documented information object in between within the reasoning chain that would represent the result of the interaction of the observer or device with reality. Therefore, determining properties of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is regarded as an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment, which may be inferred from observing and measuring representative carriers. In the case that the carrier can be named, the property P16 used specific object (was used for) should be used to indicate the instance(s) of E18 Physical Thing that was used as the empirical basis for the attribute assignment. For instance, inferring properties of depicted items using image material, such as satellite images, is not regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement, but as a subsequent instance of E13 Attribute Assignment. Rather, only the production of the images, understood as arrays of radiation intensities, is regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement. The same reasoning holds for other sensor data.\n\nExamples:\n- measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (fictitious)\n- the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 [The carbon 14 dating of an approximately 400.000 year old complete Old Palaeolithic wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany, in 1995.] (Kouwenhoven, 1997)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E16(x) ⇒ E13(x)\n"

The fact that a persona may erroneously be classified as an instance of E21 Person does not imply that the concept comprises personae.\n\nExamples:\n- Tut-Ankh-Amun (Edwards and Boltin, 1979)\n- Nelson Mandela (Brown and Hort, 2006)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E21(x) ⇒ E20(x)\n- E21(x) ⇒ E39(x)\n"

This class comprises, besides others, human-made objects, such as a sword, and human-made features, such as rock art. For example, a “cup and ring” carving on bedrock is regarded as instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.\nInstances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may be the result of modifying pre-existing physical things, preserving larger parts or most of the original matter and structure, which poses the question if they are new or even human-made, the respective interventions of production made on such original material should be obvious and sufficient to regard that the product has a new, distinct identity and intended function and is human-made. Substantial continuity of the previous matter and structure in the new product can be documented by describing the production process also as an instance of E81 Transformation.\nWhereas interventions of conservation and repair are not regarded to produce a new instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing, the results of preparation of natural history specimens that substantially change their natural or original state should be regarded as instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Things, including the uncovering of petrified biological features from a solid piece of stone. On the other side, scribbling a museum number on a natural object should not be regarded to make it human-made. This notwithstanding, parts, sections, segments, or features of an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may continue to be non-human-made and preserved during the production process, for example natural pearls used as a part of an eardrop.\n\nExamples:\n- the Forth Railway Bridge (Shipway, Bouch, Baker and Fowler, 1990).\n- the Channel Tunnel (E25) (Holliday, Marcou and Vickerman, 1991)\n- the Palace of Knossos (Evans, 1921)\n- the Colosseum in Rome, Italy (Hopkins and Beard, 2011)\n- the Historical Collection of the Museum Benaki in Athens (E78) (Georgoula, 2005)\n- the Rosetta Stone (E22)\n- my paperback copy of Crime & Punishment (E22) (fictitious)\n- the computer disk at ICS-FORTH that stores the canonical Definition of the CIDOC CRM v.3.2 (E22)\n- my empty DVD disk (E22) (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E24(x) ⇒ E18(x)\n- E24(x) ⇒ E71(x)\n"

For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not. \nInstances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature. \nThis definition coincides with the definition of “fiat objects”, with the exception of aggregates of “bona fide objects” (Smith & Varzi, 2000).\n\nExamples:\n- the cave of Dirou, Mani, Greece (Psimenos. 2005)\n- the temple in Abu Simbel before its removal, which was carved out of solid rock (E25) (Hawass, 2000)\n- Albrecht Duerer's signature on his painting of Charles the Great (E25) (Strauss, 1974)\n- the damage to the nose of the Great Sphinx in Giza (Temple, 2009)\n- Michael Jackson’s nose prior to plastic surgery\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E26(x) ⇒ E18(x)\n"

The size, orientation, and colour may change, but the logo remains uniquely identifiable. The same is true of images that are reproduced many times. This means that visual items are independent of their physical support.\nThe E36 Visual Item class provides a means of identifying and linking together instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing that carry the same visual symbols, marks, or images, etc. The property P62 depicts (is depicted by) between E24 Physical Human-Made Thing and the depicted subjects (E1 CRM Entity) can be regarded as a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Human-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1 CRM Entity, which in addition captures the optical features of the depiction.\n\nExamples:\n- the visual appearance of Monet’s “La Pie” (Bortolatto, 1981)\n- the Coca-Cola logo (E34)\n- the Chi-Rho (E37)\n- the communist red star (E37)\n- the surface shape of Auguste Rodin's statue \"Le Penseur\" [There exist more than 20 copies, even of different size.

    "@value" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an instance of E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore, E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical birth, an instance of E67 Birth, can be seen as both a single event, i.e. an instance of E5 Event, and as an extended period, i.e. an instance of E4 Period, that consists of multiple physical processes and complementary activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\nE4 Period is a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime Volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CIDOC CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance, it is possible to discuss the physical extent of an instance of E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomenon while an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\nTypical use of this class in cultural heritage documentation is for documenting cultural and artistic periods. There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period in the European sphere of influence lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\nA geopolitical unit as a specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena related to the claim of power, the consequences of belonging to a jurisdictional area and an administrative system that establishes a geopolitical unit. Examples from the modern period are countries or administrative areas of countries such as districts whose actions and structures define activities and phenomena in the area that they intend to govern. The borders of geopolitical units are often defined in contracts or treaties although they may deviate from the actual practice. The spatiotemporal properties of Geopolitical units can be modelled through the properties inherited from E92 Spacetime Volume.\nAnother specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the actual extent of the set of activities and phenomena as evidenced by their physical traces that define a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\n- Jurassic (Hallam, 1975)\n- Populated Period of Nineveh\n- Imperial Rome under Marcus Aurelius\n- European Bronze Age (Harrison, 2004) \n- Italian Renaissance (Macdonald, 1992)\n- Thirty Years War (Lee, 1991)\n- Sturm und Drang (Berkoff, 2013)\n- Cubism (Cox, 2000)\n- The Capital of Russia (E4) [the capital of Russia in the sense of an administrative unit moved in historical times from Moscow to St Petersburg and then back to Moscow. This exemplifies an administrative unit changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]\n- The settling activity of the community of Helsinki (a.k.a. Helsingfors) (E7) [the original settlement called Helsinki was located in the area of the modern airport. The community moved later to settle on the coast. This exemplifies a continued activity changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]\n- Bronze Age (E4) [Bronze Age, in the sense of technological adoption, spread over disjoint areas including islands such as the British Isles without temporal discontinuity]\n- Japan, the state (E4) [In 2021, the Japanese state as a political unit comprised in 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E4(x) ⇒ E2(x)\n- E4(x) ⇒ E92(x)\n"

Comparing knowledge about time-spans is fundamental for chronological reasoning.\nSome instances of E52 Time-Span may be defined as the actual, in principle observable, temporal extent of instances of E2 Temporal Entity via the property P4 has time-span (is time-span of): E52 Time-Span. They constitute phenomenal time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013). Since our knowledge of history is imperfect and physical phenomena are fuzzy in nature, the extent of phenomenal time-spans can only be described in approximation. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an instance of E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. It may, nevertheless, be associated with other descriptions by which people can infer knowledge about it, such as in relative chronologies.\nSome instances of E52 may be defined precisely as representing a declaration of a temporal extent, as, for instance, done in a business contract.

They may serve describing the physical location of things or phenomena or other areas of interest. Geometrically, instances of E53 Place constitute single contiguous areas or a finite aggregation of disjoint areas in space which are each individually contiguous. They may have fuzzy boundaries.\nThe instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks, but may also be determined by reference to mobile objects. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame.\nIt is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, people are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object, i.e. H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\nAny instance of E18 Physical Thing can serve as a frame of reference for an instance of E53 Place. This may be documented using the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).\n\nExamples:\n- the extent of the UK in the year 2003\n- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring (fictitious)\n- the place referred to in the phrase: “Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone”\n- here -> <- [the place between these two arrows in one of the reader's paper copy of this document.

    "@value" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured by some calibrated means and can be approximated by values, i.e. points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual space, such as natural or real numbers, RGB values, etc.\nAn instance of E54 Dimension represents the empirical or theoretically derived quantity, including the precision tolerances resulting from the particular method or calculation. The identity of an instance of E54 Dimension depends on the method of its determination because each method may produce different values even when determining comparable qualities. For instance, the wingspan of a bird alive or dead is a different dimension. Thermoluminescence dating and Rehydroxylation [RHX] dating are different dimensions of temporal distance from now, even if they aim at dating the same object. The method of determination should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). Note that simple terms such as “diameter” or “length” are normally insufficient to unambiguously describe a respective dimension. In contrast, “maximum linear extent” may be sufficient.\nThe properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of instances of E54 Dimension adequate to the precision of the applied method of determination. If the respective quantity belongs to a non-discrete space according to the laws of physics, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that comparability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.\nNumerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension, as appropriate.\n\nExamples:\n- the weight of the Luxor Obelisk [250 metric tons]\n- the vertical height of the statue of David by Michelangelo [5.17 metres]\n- the weight of the Great Star of Africa diamond [530.2 carats]\n- the calibrated C14 date for the Shroud of Turin [AD1262-1312, 1303-1384]\n- the horizontal diameter of the Stonehenge Sarsen Circle [33 metres] (Pryor, 2016)\n- the length of the sides of the Great Pyramid at Giza [230.34 metres] (Lehner and Hawass, 2017)\n- the duration of the time-span of the Battle of Issos/Issus on 15(th) November 333 B.C.E. [less than 12 hours] (Howard, 2012)\n- Christie’s hammer price, in British Pounds, for Vincent van Gogh's \"Still Life: Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers\" in London on 30(th) March 1987 (E97) [24.75 million GBP (British Pounds)]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E54(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n"

    "@value" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises distinct, delimited and coherent processes and interactions of a material nature, in cultural, social or physical systems, involving and affecting instances of E77 Persistent Item in a way characteristic of the kind of process. Typical examples are meetings, births, deaths, actions of decision taking, making or inventing things, but also more complex and extended ones such as conferences, elections, building of a castle, or battles.\nWhile the continuous growth of a tree lacks the limits characteristic of an event, its germination from a seed does qualify as an event. Similarly, the blowing of the wind lacks the distinctness and limits of an event, but a hurricane, flood or earthquake would qualify as an event. Mental processes are considered as events, in cases where they are connected with the material externalization of their results; for example, the creation of a poem, a performance or a change of intention that becomes obvious from subsequent actions or declarations.\nThe effects of an instance of E5 Event may not lead to relevant permanent changes of properties or relations of the items involved in it, for example an unrecorded performance. Of course, in order to be documented, some kind of evidence for an event must exist, be it witnesses, traces or products of the event.\nWhile instances of E4 Period always require some form of coherence between its constituent phenomena, in addition, the essential constituents of instances of E5 Event should contribute to an overall effect; for example, the statements made during a meeting and the listening of the audience.\nViewed at a coarse level of detail, an instance of E5 Event may appear as if it had an ‘instantaneous’ overall effect, but any process or interaction of material nature in reality have an extent in time and space. At a fine level, instances of E5 Event may be analysed into component phenomena and phases within a space and timeframe, and as such can be seen as a period, regardless of the size of the phenomena. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy overall effect and are thus not instances of E5 Event.\n\nExamples:\n- the birth of Cleopatra (E67) (Pomeroy, 1984)\n- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (E6) (Camardo, 2013)\n- World War II (E7) (Barber, 1994)\n- the Battle of Stalingrad (E7) (Hoyt, 1993)\n- the Yalta Conference (E7) (Harbutt, 2010)\n- my birthday celebration 28-6-1995 (E7)\n- the falling of a tile from my roof last Sunday (fictitious)\n- the CIDOC conference 2003 (E7)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E5(x) ⇒ E4(x)\n"

An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the original.

In such cases, it may happen that the group never had more than one member. A joint pseudonym (i.e. a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually used as a persona by two or more people) is a particular case of E74 Group.\nA gathering of people becomes an instance of E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together. These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modelled as membership in an instance of E74 Group. Married couples and other concepts of family are regarded as particular examples of E74 Group.\n\nExamples:\n- the Impressionists (Wilson, 1994)\n- the Navajo (Correll, 1972)\n- the Greeks (Williams, 1993)\n- the peace protestors in New York City on 15(th) February 2003\n- Exxon-Mobil (Raymond, 2006)\n- King Solomon and his wives (Thieberger, 1947)\n- the President of the Swiss Confederation\n- Nicolas Bourbaki [the collective pseudonym of a group of mathematicians, predominantly French alumni of the École normale supérieure] (Aczel, 2007)\n- Betty Crocker (Crocker, 2012)\n- Ellery Queen [Ellery Queen is a pseudonym created in 1929 by American crime fiction writers Frederic Dannay and Manfred Bennington Lee.] (Wheat, 2005)\n- Greenpeace\n- Paveprime Ltd\n- the National Museum of Denmark\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E74(x) ⇒ E39(x)\n"

Persistent Items may be physical entities, such as people, animals or things, conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or even names. \nInstances of E77 Persistent Item may be present or be part of interactions in different periods or events. They can repeatedly be recognized at disparate occasions during their existence by characteristics of structural nature. The respective characteristics need not be exactly the same during all the existence of an instance of E77 Persistent Item. Often, they undergo gradual change, still bearing some similarities with that of previous times, or disappear completely and new emerge. For instance, a person, from the time of being born on, will gradually change all its features and acquire new ones, such as a scar. Even the DNA in different body cells will develop defects and mutations. Nevertheless, relevant characteristics used should be sufficiently similar to recognize the instance for some substantial period of time. \nThe more specific criteria that determine the identity of instances of subclasses of E77 Persistent Item may vary considerably and are described or referred to in the respective scope notes. The decision about which exact criteria to use depends on whether the observable behaviour of the respective part of reality such confined conforms to the reasoning the user is interested in. For example, a building can be regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria, such as being bodily separated from other persons. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. On the opposite, the identity of a (version of a) text of a scientific publication is given by the exact arrangement of its relevant symbols. \nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope of the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties. \nAn instance of E77 Persistent Item does not require actual knowledge of the identifying features of the instance being currently known. There may be cases, where the actual identifying features of an instance of E77 Persistent Item are not decidable at a particular state of knowledge.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci (E21) (Strano, 1953)\n- Stonehenge (E24) (Pryor, 2016)\n- the hole in the ozone layer (E4) (Hufford and Horwitz, 2005)\n- the First Law of Thermodynamics (E89) (Craig and Gislason, 2002)\n- the Bermuda Triangle (E53) (Dolan, 2005)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E77(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n"

Instances of E81 Transformation are therefore distinct from re-classifications (documented using E17 Type Assignment) or modifications (documented using E11 Modification) of objects that do not fundamentally change their nature or identity. Characteristic cases are reconstructions and repurposing of historical buildings or ruins, fires leaving buildings in ruins, taxidermy of specimen in natural history.\nEven though such instances of E81 Transformation are often motivated by a change of intended use, substantial material changes should justify the documentation of the result as a new instance of E18 Physical Thing and not just the change of function. The latter may be documented as an extended activity (instance of E7 Activity) of using it.\n\nExamples:\n- the mummification of Tut-Ankh-Amun (E81, E12) [the mummification of the body of the deceased is a human production process and simultaneously preserves structures of the body at and before death] (Carter and Mace 1977)\n- the death, carbonization and petrification of some people of Pompeii in 79AD by the intense heat of a pyroclastic cloud and ashes from the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius (E69, E81)\n- the transformation of the Hephaisteion temple in Athens, better known as “Theseion”, into a Christian church, dedicated to Saint George <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George> around AD 700 (E81,E12) [which actually helped preserving part of the antique temple structure from 449BC]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E81(x) ⇒ E63(x)\n- E81(x) ⇒ E64(x)\n"

    "@value" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises transfers of legal ownership from one or more instances of E39 Actor to one or more other instances of E39 Actor. \nThe class also applies to the establishment or loss of ownership of instances of E18 Physical Thing. It does not, however, imply changes of any other kinds of rights. The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E8 Acquisition there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances, it may describe:\n1. the beginning of ownership\n2. the end of ownership\n3. the transfer of ownership\n4. the acquisition from an unknown source\n5. the loss of title due to destruction of the item\nIt may also describe events where a collector appropriates legal title, for example, by annexation or field collection. The interpretation of the museum notion of “accession” differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership (E8 Acquisition) and physical custody (E10 Transfer of Custody) separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.\n\nExamples:\n- the collection of a hammerhead shark, genus Sphyrna (Carchariniformes), by John Steinbeck and Edward Ricketts at Puerto Escondido in the Gulf of Mexico on 25(th) March 1940. (Steinbeck, 2000)\n- the acquisition of El Greco’s “The Apostles Peter and Paul” by the State Hermitage in Saint Petersburg. (https://hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/32730)\n- the loss of my stuffed Fringilla coelebs due to insect damage last year (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E8(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n"

In other words, instances of this class fix a slice of another instance of E92 Spacetime Volume in time. \nThe temporal extent of an instance of E93 Presence typically is predetermined by the researcher so as to focus the investigation particularly on finding the spatial extent of the phenomenon by testing for its characteristic features. There are at least two basic directions such investigations might take. The investigation may wish to determine where something was during some time or it may wish to reconstruct the total passage of a phenomenon’s spacetime volume through an examination of discrete presences. Observation and measurement of features indicating the presence or absence of a phenomenon in some space allows for the progressive approximation of spatial extents through argumentation typically based on inclusion, exclusion and various overlaps.\n\nExamples:\n- the Roman Empire on 19(th) August AD 14 (Clare and Edwards, 1992)\n- Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s whereabouts in December 1775 (Leppmann, 1970)\n- Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s whereabouts from 19(th) November 1755 until 9(th) April 1768 (Leppmann, 1970)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E93(x) ⇒ E92(x)\n"

The product type is the intended ideal form of the manufacture process. It is typical of instances of E22 Human-Made Object that conform to an instance of E99 Product Type that its component parts are interchangeable with component parts of other instances of E22 Human-Made Object made after the model of the same instance of E99 Product Type. Frequently, the uniform production according to a given instance of E99 Product Type is achieved by creating individual tools, such as moulds or print plates that are themselves carriers of the design of the product type. Modern tools may use the flexibility of electronically controlled devices to achieve such uniformity. The product type itself, i.e. the potentially unlimited series of aesthetically equivalent items, may be the target of artistic design, rather than the individual object. In extreme cases, only one instance of a product type may have been produced, such as in a “print on demand” process which was only triggered once. However, this should not be confused with industrial prototypes, such as car prototypes, which are produced prior to the production line being set up, or test the production line itself.\n\nExamples:\n- Volkswagen Type 11 [Beetle] (Rieger, 2013)\n- Dragendorff 54 samian vessel\n- 1937 Edward VIII brass threepenny bit \n- Qin Crossbow trigger un-notched Part B (Bg2u) (Li, 2012)\n- Nokia Cityman 1320 [The first Nokia mobile phone]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E99(x) ⇒ E55(x)\n"

Note, that the human mind can be such a carrier. A precondition for a transfer of information to a person or another new physical carrier is the presence of the respective information object and this person or physical thing in one event.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- Deckchair 42 (E19) was present at the sinking of the Titanic (E5). (Aldridge, 2008)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P12(x,y) ⇒ E5(x)\n- P12(x,y) ⇒ E77(y)\n"

(Briquet, 1985)\n- The visual content of Jacopo Amigoni’s painting known as ‘The Singer Farinelli and friends’ (E36) incorporates the musical notation of Farinelli’s musical work entitled ‘La Partenza’ (E73). (National Gallery of Victoria)\n- The visual content of Nicolas Poussin’s painting entitled ‘Les Bergers d’Arcadie’ (E36) incorporates the Latin phrase ‘Et in Arcadia ego’ (E33).

(Briquet, 1985)\n- The visual content of Jacopo Amigoni’s painting known as ‘The Singer Farinelli and friends’ (E36) incorporates the musical notation of Farinelli’s musical work entitled ‘La Partenza’ (E73). (National Gallery of Victoria)\n- The visual content of Nicolas Poussin’s painting entitled ‘Les Bergers d’Arcadie’ (E36) incorporates the Latin phrase ‘Et in Arcadia ego’ (E33). (Wikipedia, 2020)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P165(x,y) ⇒ E73(x)\n- P165(x,y) ⇒ E90(y)\n- P165(x,y) ⇒ P106(x,y)\n- P165(x,y) ⇒ ¬P165(y,x)\n"

Note that the properties defined by the CIDOC CRM also constitute instances of E55 Type themselves. The direction of the assigned property of type is understood to be from the attributed item (the range of property P140 assigned attribute to) to the attribute item (the range of the property P141 assigned). More than one property type may be assigned to hold between two items.\nA comprehensive explanation about refining CIDOC CRM concepts by E55 Type is given in the section “About Types” in the section on “Specific Modelling Constructs” of this document.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The Current Ownership Assessment of Martin Doerr’s silver cup February 1997 (E13) assigned property of type P52 has former or current owner (is former or current keeper of) (E55).

[‘binding structure type’ refers to a property, external to the CIDOC CRM, which connects a book (E22) to the type of its binding structure (E55)] (Honey & Pickwoad, 2010)\n- The condition assessment of the endband cores of MS Sinai Greek 418 (E14) assigned property of type damage (E55).

The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.\nIn common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g. in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g. if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as an approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge. \nIn more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature. If the methodology is known a maximum deviation from the measured point can be calculated and the encounter spot or feature may be related to the resulting circle using an instance of P171 at some place within.\nThis property is not transitive.

The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.\nIn common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g. in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g. if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as an approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge. \nIn more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map.

The representation may be more specific than the symbolic level defining the identity condition of the represented. This depends on the type of the symbolic object represented. For instance, if a name has type “Modern Greek character sequence”, it may be represented in a loss-free Latin transcription, meaning however the sequence of Greek letters. \nAs another example, if the represented object has type “English words sequence”, American English or British English spelling variants may be chosen to represent the English word “colour” without defining a different symbolic object. If a name has type “European traditional name”, no particular string may define its content.\n\nExamples:\n- The materials description of the painting (E33) has symbolic content “Oil, French Watercolors on Paper, Graphite and Ink on Canvas, with an Oak frame.” (E62).\n- The title of Einstein’s 1915 text (E35) has symbolic content “Relativity, the Special and the General Theory” (E62).

This property includes in particular identification by mathematical expressions such as coordinate systems used for the identification of instances of E53 Place. The property does not reveal anything about when, where and by whom this identifier was used. A more detailed representation can be made using the fully developed (i.e. indirect) path through E15 Identifier Assignment.\nThis property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P140i was attributed by, E15 Identifier Assignment, P37 assigned to E42 Identifier. \nIt is also a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P1 is identified by, E41 Appellation, P139 has alternative form to E41 Appellation.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The capital of Italy (E53) is identified by “Rome” (E41). (Leach, 2017)\n- Text 25014–32 (E33) is identified by “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” (E35). (Gibbon, 2013)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P1(x,y) ⇒ E1(x)\n- P1(x,y) ⇒ E41(y)\n- P1(x,y) ⇐ (∃z) [E15(z)˄ P140i(x,z) ˄ P37(z,y)]\n- P1(x,y) ⇐ (∃z) [E41(z)˄ P1(x,z) ˄ P139(z,y)]\n"

Good practice requires use of distinct note fields for different aspects of a characterisation. The P3.1 has type property of P3 has note allows differentiation of specific notes, e.g. “construction”, “decoration”, etc. \nAn item may have many notes, but a note is attached to a specific item.\n\nExamples:\n- Coffee mug – OXCMS:1983.1.1 (E19) has note “chipped at edge of handle” (E62) has type Condition (E55). (fictitious)\n\nProperties:\n- P3.1 has type: E55 Type\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P3(x,y) ⇒ E1(x)\n- P3(x,y) ⇒ E62(y) \n- P3(x,y,z) ⇒ [P3(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]\n"

P7 took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.\nAny place where something happened includes the spatial projection of the happening given in the same geometric reference system. For instance, HMS Victory, as place of Lord Nelson's dying, includes the location of his body relative to the hull of HMS Victory at his time of death as the most precise location of his death. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection, an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections to respective reference systems, that is, instances of E53 Place. Therefore, this property implies the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place, where both places are defined in the same geometric reference system. The relation between an instance of E53 Place and its reference system can conveniently be documented via the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).\nSomething that has happened at a given place can also be considered to have happened at a smaller place within it: for example, it is reasonable to say Caesar’s murder took place in Rome, but also on the Forum Romanum, and more precisely in the Curia. It is characteristic for different historical sources to use varying precision in such statements, without being in contradiction with each other. This may be due to lack of knowledge or to the relevance of the precision for the purpose of the statement. In information integration, the more precise statement improves the overall knowledge.\n\nExamples:\n- The period “Révolution française” (E4) took place at the area covered by France in 1789 (E53). (Bertaud, 2004)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ E4(x)\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ E53(y)\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ (∃z,u) [P157(y,u) ˄ P157(z,u) ˄ P161(x,z) ˄ P89(z,y)]\n- [E4(x) ˄ P157(y,u) ˄ P157(v,u) ˄ P7(x,y) ˄ P161(x,z) ˄ P89(z,v) ˄ P89(v,y)] ⇒ P7(x,v)\n"

P7 took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.\nAny place where something happened includes the spatial projection of the happening given in the same geometric reference system. For instance, HMS Victory, as place of Lord Nelson's dying, includes the location of his body relative to the hull of HMS Victory at his time of death as the most precise location of his death. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection, an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections to respective reference systems, that is, instances of E53 Place. Therefore, this property implies the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place, where both places are defined in the same geometric reference system. The relation between an instance of E53 Place and its reference system can conveniently be documented via the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).\nSomething that has happened at a given place can also be considered to have happened at a smaller place within it: for example, it is reasonable to say Caesar’s murder took place in Rome, but also on the Forum Romanum, and more precisely in the Curia. It is characteristic for different historical sources to use varying precision in such statements, without being in contradiction with each other. This may be due to lack of knowledge or to the relevance of the precision for the purpose of the statement. In information integration, the more precise statement improves the overall knowledge.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The period “Révolution française” (E4) took place at the area covered by France in 1789 (E53). (Bertaud, 2004)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ E4(x)\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ E53(y)\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ (∃z,u) [P157(y,u) ˄ P157(z,u) ˄ P161(x,z) ˄ P89(z,y)]\n- [E4(x) ˄ P157(y,u) ˄ P157(v,u) ˄ P7(x,y) ˄ P161(x,z) ˄ P89(z,v) ˄ P89(v,y)] ⇒ P7(x,v)\n"

    "@value" : "Scope note:\nThis class comprises activities of excavating in the sense of archaeology, which are documented as a coherent set of actions of progressively recording and removing matter from a pre-specified location under specific rules. Typically, an instance of A1 Excavation Processing Unit would be terminated if significant discontinuities of substance or finds come to light, or if the activity is interrupted due to external factors, such as end of a working day. In other cases, the termination would be based on predefined physical specifications, such as the boundaries of a maximal volume of matter to be excavated in one unit of excavation.\nDepending on the methodology, an instance of A1 Excavation Processing Unit may intend to remove matter only within the boundaries of a particular stratigraphic unit, or it may follow a pre-declared spatial extent such as a trench. It may only uncover, clean or expose a structure or parts of it.\nThe process of excavation results in the production of a set of recorded (documentation) data that should be sufficient to provide researchers enough information regarding the consistency and spatial distribution of the excavated Segment of Matter and things and features embedded in it. Some parts or all of the removed physical material (instances of S11 Amount of Matter) may be dispersed, whereas others may be kept in custody in the form of finds or samples, while others (such as parts of walls) may be left at the place of their discovery. The data produced by an instance of A1 Excavation Processing Unit should pertain to the material state of matter at excavation time only and should be clearly distinguished from subsequent interpretation about the causes for this state of matter.\nThe current class A1 Excavation Processing Unit is somewhat overloaded and may be split into two subclasses, one for the intellectual process and one for the physical process. This is left for a future refinement of the model.\n\nExamples:\n- The activity taking place on 21.9.2007 between 12:00 and 13:00 that excavated the Stratigraphic Volume Unit “(2)” of Figure 4 and created the surface “S1” \n- The activity that excavated the first 20 cm of a spit excavation on 21.7.2007 created the surface “S2” in Figure 4.\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- A1(x) ⇒ S1(x)\n- A1(x) ⇒ S4(x)\n- A1(x) ⇒ E12(x)\n- A1(x) ⇒ E64(x)\n"

These processes are usually not only due to natural forces (i.e., climate, the impact of flora and fauna, other natural events), but also to human activities, in particular excavation and construction. An event of stratification genesis typically produces two main forms of stratification units, both a deposit and an interface.\n\nExamples:\n- the production of the stratigraphic interface “[3]” by the cut in the pre-existing strata of the posthole –see Figure 6\n- the production of the stratigraphic unit volume “(18)” via the filling of the posthole with detritus or some other matter –see Figure 6\n- the creation of the one-meter-thick level of pumice caused by the Minoan eruption of Thera and consisting of five distinct layers, which covers the ruins at the excavation Akrotiri, Thera –see Figure 9 (Doumas et al., 2015)\n- the creation of the 8-10-metre-thick level of successive layers volcanic ash deposed on top of the one-meter-thick level of pumice, which covers the ruins at the excavation Akrotiri, Thera—see Figure 9 (Doumas et al., 2015)\n- the production of the deposits L14-L18 and L22-L24 by at least seven (7) distinct fill episodes of a neolithic ditch, observed at the northern section of Trenches 6 and 21, at the site Paliambela, Kolindros–see Figure 10\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- A4(x) ⇒ S17(x)\n- A4(x) ⇒ A5(x)\n"

The genesis of such objects may be the result of human, biological, geological or other processes. This property makes a weak statement about the distribution of the associated object kind in the archaeological record: that is, if the genesis of an object of the type can plausibly be assumed to fall within the genesis of the context within which it was found, then this property supports reasoning, ceteris paribus, that the genesis period of the context forms part of, or overlaps with, one of the instances of E4 Period in which the respective object type has appeared. Such weak statements may also be useful in the context of geological or paleontological observations. Stronger claims can be made using the properties AP30 restricted to and AP31 typical for.\n\nExamples:\n- The “Cycladic” figurine type (E55) appears in the Early Cycladic period (E4).

However, the association of the two events is based on their temporal proximity, with the triggering event ending when the triggered event starts.\n\nExamples:\n- The earthquake of Parnitha in 1999 (E5) triggered the rotational landslide that was observed along the road on the same day (E5).

It identifies the interaction between events: an event can activate (trigger) other events in a target system that is in a situation of sustained tension, such as a trap or an unstable mountain slope giving way to a land slide after a rain or earthquake. In that sense the triggering event is interpreted as a cause. However, the association of the two events is based on their temporal proximity, with the triggering event ending when the triggered event starts.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The earthquake of Parnitha in 1999 (E5) triggered the rotational landslide that was observed along the road on the same day (E5). (fictitious)\n- The explosion at the Montserrat massif in 2007 (E5) (near Barcelona, Spain) triggered the rock fall event (E5) which happened on 2007-02-14 (Vilajosana et al., 2008).\n- The 1966 flood in Florence (E5) triggered mould growth on books (E5) stored in flooded library rooms (Rubinstein, N., 1966)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- O13(x,y) ⇒ E5(x)\n- O13(x,y) ⇒ E5(y)\n- O13(x,y) ⇒ P182(x,y)\n"

The latter representation allows for more formal reasoning with the model, the former is more flexible about the kinds of observations.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The seismic hazard analysis and recording by EPPO in 1990 (S4), in the area of Attiki observed property type share wave velocity (S9) and recorded it (Lucchese et al., 2013; Kritikos et al., 2013; InGeoCloudS, 2012; InGeoCloudS, 2013)\n- The Gas Chromatography analysis (S4) of the sample ‘mid-blue paint from the sky’ observed property type retention time (S9).

In some cases, the spatiotemporal confinement of the event itself, such as a flash, a car stopping etc. marks the limits of a documented observation of an event. In other cases, such as the situation of a car passing by a certain object, the spatiotemporal limits of the event of observing itself, as well as the direction of attention or the orientation of used instruments, may constrain the observed detail of a larger process, e.g., noticing the sight of a car passing by; a light emission, etc.\nConceptual objects manifest through their carriers such as books, digital media, or even human memory. Attributes of conceptual objects, such as number of words, can be observed on their carriers. If the respective properties between carriers differ, either they carry different instances of conceptual objects or the difference can be attributed to accidental deficiencies in one of the carriers. In that sense even immaterial objects are observable. By this model we address the fact that frequently, the actually observed carriers of conceptual objects are not explicitly identified in documentation, i.e., they are assumed to have existed but they are unknown as individuals.\n\nExamples:\n- the domestic goose from Guangdong/1/1996 (H5N1) that was identified in 1996 in farmed geese in southern China as circulating highly pathogenic H5N1 (E20) (Wan, 2012)\n- the flight of a male Bearded Vulture observed near Loukia, Heraklion, Crete in the morning of the 24(th) of October 2020 (E5) [The Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus Barbatus) is a threatened species in Crete] (Claes, 2020)\n- the eruption of Krakatoa volcano at Indonesia in 1883 (E5) (Symons et al., 1888)\n- the cupid head area in the X-Ray of the painting ‘Cupid complaining to Venus’ (E25) (The National Gallery, London, 1963)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- S15(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n"

This observation produces knowledge about the existence of the respective thing at a particular place in or on surrounding matter. This knowledge may be new to the group of people the actor belongs to. In that case we would talk about a discovery. The observer may recognize or assign an individual identity of the thing encountered or regard only the type as noteworthy in the associated documentation or report.\nIn archaeology there is a particular interest if an object is found “in situ”, i.e. if its embedding in the surrounding matter supports the assumption that the object was not moved since the archaeologically relevant deposition event. The surrounding matter with the relative position of the object in it as well as the absolute position and time of the observation may be recorded in order to enable inferences about the history of the object.\nIn Biology, additional parameters may be recorded like the kind of ecosystem, if the biological individual survives the observation, what detection or catching devices have been used or if the encounter event supported the detection of a new biological kind (“taxon”).\n\nExamples:\n- the finding, by Prof. Stampolidis, of a complete skeleton, in situ, at the site of Eleutherna during the archaeological excavation carried out by the University of Crete in 2007 (S19) (Bonn-Muller, 2010)\n- the detection of lagocephalos_Sceleratus was carried out with the trawler 419 in the Mediteranean sea, during the first week of August 2014 (S19) (Bekiari et al., 2014)\n- the encounter of the marble floor of the Villa of the Papyri in Herculaneum during the digging of a well in 1750 (S19) (Sider, 1990, p. 536)\n- the encounter of oak planks from a ship during a dig in a mound at the farm Lille Oseberg in Norway in 1908 (S19) (Ferguson, 2009, p.10-11)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- S19(x) ⇒ S4(x)\n"

The maximum volume in space that an instance of S20 Rigid Physical Feature occupies defines uniquely a place for the feature with respect to its surrounding matter.\nTherefore we model S20 Rigid Physical Feature as a subclass of E26 Physical Feature and of E53 Place. The latter is intended as a phenomenal place as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss positions relative to the extent of an instance of S20 Rigid Physical Feature without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated place. However, since the identity and existence of this place depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of S20 Rigid Physical Feature as matter, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language. It shortcuts an implicit self-referential path from E26 Physical Feature through P156 occupies, E53 Place, P157 is at rest relative to E26 Physical Feature.\nIn cases of instances of S20 Rigid Physical Feature on or in the surface of earth, the default reference is typically fixed to the closer environment of the tectonic plate or sea floor. In cases of features on mobile objects, the reference space is typically fixed to the geometry of the bearing object. Note that the reference space associated with the instance of S20 Rigid Physical Feature may quite well be deformed over time, as long the continuity of its topology does not become unclear, such as the compression of dinosaur bones in geological layers, or the distortions of the hull of a ship by the waves of the sea. Defined in this way, the reference space can be used as a means to infer from current topological relationships past topological relationships of interest.\n\nExamples:\n- the temple in Abu Simbel before its removal, which was carved out of solid rock (‘Abu Simbel’, Wikipedia, 2022)\n- Albrecht Duerer's signature on his painting of Charles the Great (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, 2022)\n- the damaged form of the nose of the Great Sphinx in Giza (‘Great Sphinx of Giza’, Wikipedia, 2022)\n- the ‘Central Orygma’ (pit-house) which dominates the central part of the excavated area of the settlement of Mavropigi, representing phases I-III (Karamitrou-Mentessidi et al., 2015)\n- the top surface of the clay floor A11 [Heterogeneous, yellow to grey silty clay; clear, wavy lower boundary] (illu p. 1601, Croix et al, 2019)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- S20(x) ⇒ E18(x)\n- S20(x) ⇒ E53(x)\n"

The spatial extent of an instance of S22 Segment of Matter may be declared or defined by a researcher or observer usually because the arrangement and composition of substance is characteristic for the surrounding matter or can be interpreted as traces of its genesis and subsequent internal and external processes it was exposed to. The defining spatial extent is typically declared on a continuous matter by means of geometric determination without observable boundaries on all sides or any side. It may however be extracted at some point in time along the declared boundaries.\nAn instance of S22 Segment of Matter is regarded to be existing from the time on it completely solidified with a structure that is still preserved in a recognizable way at the time of its spatial definition. Its existence is regarded to end when its respective integrity is partially or completely corrupted. Uncorrupted subsections of an instance of S22 Segment of Matter may continue to exist as segments of matter in their own right beyond the existence of the containing instance, and may have solidified before it.\nTypical examples are segments of archaeological or geological layers. They are regarded as uncorrupted even if they have undergone conformal deformations, such as compressions or shifts, as long as the effects of these deformations do not destroy the relevant structures of interest. This means that the defining spatial volume may be only geometrically valid for an instant of time for which it was declared, and undergo before and after deformations. In some cases, it may be possible to calculate the initial volume at the time of solidification, for instance for petrified bones compressed in Jurassic layers.\n\nExamples:\n- the clay floor A11 [Heterogeneous, yellow to grey silty clay; clear, wavy lower boundary] (illu p. 1601, Croix et al, 2019)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- S22(x) ⇒ S20(x)\n"

The determined position is intended to approximate a part or all of the extent of the presence (instance of E93 Presence) of an instance of E18 Physical Thing or E4 Period of interest, such as the outer walls of an excavated settlement, the position of a ship sailing or the start and end of athlete's run in a competition. Characteristically, a theodolite or GPS device may be positioned on some persistent feature. Determining the position of the device will yield an approximation of the position of the feature of interest. Alternatively, some material item may be observed moving through a determined position at a given time.\nThis class does not inherit properties from class S21 Measurement. A position determination is an evaluation of a combination of measurement of multiple associated distances and/or angles (instances of E54 Dimension) from a particular spot to certain reference points of previously known position in the same reference space. A particular role is played by the Earth's magnetic field and rotational axis as reference for an angle or direction. Often, the observed constituting dimensions are not documented, or hidden in an electronic device software. The determined position is given as an E94 Space Primitive corresponding to a declarative place. Together with the measured time-span covering the time-critical observations it forms a spacetime volume, which should normally overlap with the spatiotemporal extent of the thing or phenomenon of interest.\n\nExamples:\n- the determination of the position of the Titanic for the initial distress call after hitting an iceberg (S23) [The iceberg was hit on 14 April 1912 at 23:40 ship’s time.

Edward Smith and was transmitted 15 April 1912 at 00:27.] (Halpern, 2011)\n- the determination of the position of the Titanic by officer Joseph G. Boxhall after the initial distress signal was sent (S23) [done between 00:27 and 00:35, when Boxhall showed the coordinates to Smith] (Halpern, 2011)\n- the determination of the position of the Titanic by Robert Ballard's team after the Titanic ship-wreck was found (S23) (Ballard et al., 1987)\n- Samuel Halpern’s 2007 determination of the position of the Titanic at the time of the collision (S23) [based on the position of the ship-wreck] (Halpern, 2007)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- S23(x) ⇒ S4(x)\n- S23(x) ⇒ (∃y,z) [E94(y) ∧ S15(z) ∧ O30 (x,y) ∧ O32 (x,z)]\n"

In case of non-rigid Material Substantials, the source of sampling may regarded not to be modified by the activity of sample taking.\n\nExamples:\n- the water sampling carried out by IGME, sampled from borehole 10/G5 at 419058.03, 4506565 , 95.7 Mygdonia basin on 28/6/2005 (S2) (Lucchese et al., 2013; Kritikos et al., 2013; InGeoCloudS, 2012; InGeoCloudS, 2013)\n- the collection of specimen ‘FHO – Benth. - 1055’ from a plant of the species ‘spiciformis’ in Zambia by Bullock, A.A. in 1939 (S2)\n- the collection of micro-sample 7, from the paint layer on the area of the apple shown on the painting ‘Cupid complaining to Venus’ (Cranach) by Joyce Plesters in June 1963 (S2) (The National Gallery, London, 1963)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- S1(x) ⇒ S3(x)\n"

Primary data from measurement devices are regarded in this model to be results of observation and can be interpreted as propositions believed to be true within the (known) tolerances and degree of reliability of the device.\nMeasurements and witnessing of events are special cases of observations. Observations result in a belief that certain propositions held at a time within the time-span of the observation. In this model, the degree of confidence in the observed properties is regarded to be “true” by default, but could be described differently by adding a property P3 has note to an instance of S4 Observation\n\nExamples:\n- the excavation of unit XI by the Archaeological Institute of Crete in 2004 (S4)\n- the excavation (S4) in the NE section of the central court of the Knossos palace by the Ephorate of Antiquities of Heraklion in 1997 (S4) (Επιστημονική Επιτροπή Κνωσού, 2008)\n- the observation of the density of the X-Ray image of cupid's head from the painting ‘Cupid complaining to Venus’ as ‘high density’, on the 19th of March 1963 (S4) (The National Gallery, London, 1963).\n- the observation of visible light absorption of the painting ‘Cupid complaining to Venus’ as ‘having red pigment’, in 2015 (S4) (Foister, 2015)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- S4(x) ⇒ E13(x)\n"
